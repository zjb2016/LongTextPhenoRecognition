PMC1764756_0	"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a common, costly and preventable disease and is the fourth leading cause of death globally [1,2]. Internationally there is a substantial variation in death rate due to COPD possibly reflecting smoking behaviour, type and processing of tobacco, pollution, climate, and genetic factors. Given the fact that there is an increasing tendency to abuse tobacco [3-6], prevalence of COPD is expected to increase in the years to come. Acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD) is a common cause of emergency room (ER) visits and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Following an acute exacerbation, majority of the patients experience a temporary or permanent decrease in the quality of life [7]. Moreover, more than half the patients discharged with AE-COPD often require re-admission in the subsequent six months [7]. Thus, the economic and social burden of AE-COPD are extremely high [1]. The great variability in the course of AE-COPD even in patients with similar degree of pulmonary impairment renders the prediction of the outcome in a given patient very difficult. Most studies have tried to correlate impairment in both respiratory and non-respiratory physiology with the course and progression of the AE-COPD with inconclusive results.

Furthermore, even less data are available from India regarding the prevalence, precipitating factors and predictors of prognosis in patients with AE-COPD. Even from the developed world, while there are many published studies regarding the prognostic factors among patients with AE-COPD who are ambulatory, few studies have examined the prognostic factors in patients with severe AE-COPD who visit the ER and little is known regarding the long-term prognosis of patients with AE-COPD [8]. Keeping these factors in mind, the present study was designed to prospectively study the clinical presentation and predictors of outcome in patients with AE-COPD requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).

PMC1764756_18	"Bidi smoking is more common in lower and middle income groups especially those residing in smaller towns, and rural areas of India as bidis are cheaper than cigarettes. Furthermore, bidi smoking is considered to cause about two to three times greater nicotine and tar inhalation than do conventional cigarettes, due to the poor combustibility of the bidi and greater puff frequency needed to keep the bidi alight [11]. All these factors may exaggerate the health risks associated with bidi smoke. The burden of tobacco use is shifting from developed to developing countries and it is generally believed that smoking habit is on the rise in India [5,12].

Several causes can contribute to altered sensorium in patients with AE-COPD. These include, type II respiratory failure and carbon dioxide narcosis, metabolic abnormalities such as dyselectrolytemia, uremia and hepatic function derangement among others. As these can be corrected, an active attempt must be made to identify them when patients present to the ER with AE-COPD. This is important in developing countries like India because, majority of the patients with AE-COPD seek emergency care at primary health centres, district hospitals and general hospitals where facilities for round-the-clock laboratory monitoring are seldom available. Unless these factors, that are often correctable, are specifically sought and checked, they may be missed. Thus, these factors not only confuse the diagnosis but also contribute to mortality.

Furthermore, the co-morbid conditions can trigger AE-COPD and their presence has been considered to be a predictor of poor outcome in several studies [19]. In the present study, patients who presented with AE-COPD who also had type II diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis (n = 3); type II diabetes mellitus and active pulmonary TB (n = 5) died suggesting that complications related co-morbid conditions also contribute to the morbidity and mortality.

Guidelines for the initial diagnostic evaluation of AE-COPD should facilitate differentiating AE-COPD from other conditions which can mimick it such as congestive heart failure, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism and arrhythmias. With the evolution of a consensus definition [19], these differences are likely to be resolved.

Its principles are the same as those of palliative care, which developed in the UK in the 1960s in response to the needs of terminally ill cancer patients. With increasing recognition that those with incurable non-malignant disease also have extensive palliative care needs, specialist palliative care services are attempting to provide needs-based rather than diagnosis-based care (Addington-Hall 1998). In practice, limited resources mean that only those with the most complex needs receive specialist palliative care input.

There is strong evidence that these patients have a particularly poor quality of life in the end of life phase, due to uncontrolled symptoms, psychological morbidity, social isolation and unmet information and communication needs. Traditionally, the palliative care approach has focused on the needs of cancer patients. All patients, however, deserve good quality end of life care, irrespective of diagnosis. Mixed management models where active disease-modifying treatments are combined with palliative care interventions show great promise. Chest physicians and respiratory nurse specialists have a vital role in ensuring that the care of patients dying from COPD improves to the level of the best.

Studies based on post-bereavement interviews show that over 90% of patients are breathless in the last year of life, and in nearly half of these the breathlessness is unrelieved by treatment (Edmonds et al 2001). Skilbeck et al (1998) found that 95% of a cohort of patients that had been admitted with an exacerbation of COPD in the preceding 6 months were experiencing severe breathlessness, defined as very much on a four point intensity scale ranging from not at all to very much. Other symptoms were strikingly prevalent, including pain (68%), fatigue (68%) and insomnia (55%). Psychological morbidity is also high in COPD. Gore et al (2000) found that 90% of patients had clinically relevant anxiety or depression. Overall, there can be no doubt that the physical and psychological symptom burden from advanced COPD is at least as severe as that from other incurable diseases. Indeed, in a recent systematic review, Solano et al (2006) found that breathlessness, fatigue and anxiety occur more commonly in COPD than in advanced cancer, heart disease or renal disease (Table 1).

The disease trajectory in COPD is typically that of a slow decline, punctuated by dramatic exacerbations that often end in unexpected death (Lunney et al 2003; Murray et al 2005). This contrasts with that of cancer, where there is often maintenance of good function until a short period of relatively predictable decline in the last weeks or months of life. COPD is particularly unpredictable as it progresses at a highly variable rate. Exacerbations causing respiratory failure occur suddenly and unpredictably, and the outcome of those exacerbations is often determined by last-minute decisions regarding life support.

PMC2528206_18	"This disease trajectory has two important implications. First, it causes significant prognostication difficulties. Only dementia has been found to have a more uncertain prognosis than COPD (Hansen-Flaschen 2004). How can good EOL care be provided when it is not clear that the end of life is approaching? Until recently there has been little evidence-based information available to help determine the prognosis in advanced COPD. Commonly used prognostic criteria, including measures of air-flow limitation such as FEV1, degree of hypoxia, complications such as cor-pulmonale and recent hospitalisation requiring ventilation, have all been found to be unreliable (Fox et al 1999; Domingo-Salvany et al 2002; Nishimura et al 2002; Coventry et al 2005).

"	HP_0011009
PMC2528206_20	"Another important barrier to end of life care is that misconceptions about both COPD and palliative care abound. It is sobering that patients and caregivers generally fail to appreciate that COPD is a life-threatening disease that results in an inexorable decline in health status and function (Lynn et al 2000). Good EOL care is impossible without recognition that death may occur prematurely. The appreciation amongst patients that COPD is often a self-inflicted disease lead some to believe that they are not eligible or deserving of measures to improve quality of life. The practice of palliative care is also misunderstood. In our death-denying culture, embarking on a palliative approach can be misconstrued as evidence of failure or giving up (Croft 2005). Patients and professionals often still expect a dichotomous model of care moving from disease modification to palliation, when this has long been superseded by a mixed model of care combining both approaches.

Even for cancer patients, the historical focus of palliative care, palliative care provision is not uniform, and patients needs are not always being met. Improving the palliation of COPD has significant implications for funding, manpower and education. Palliative care specialists are not always well informed about the management of non-malignant disease and respiratory specialists require training in the skills of palliation.

From examination of all studies included in the original review and three studies published subsequently (Lewis et al 2003; Nandi et al 2003; Stevenson and Calverley 2004), it is clear that there are little data to support the use of SBOT at rest, including before or after exercise. SBOT during exercise does, however, appear to be of greater value. Out of nineteen controlled single assessment studies that recorded dyspnoea scores at isotime, all but one revealed significant relief of dyspnoea when exercising with oxygen.

PMC2528206_33	"It cannot, of course, be assumed that acute responders who gain benefit from oxygen in experimental conditions will also benefit when oxygen is used over a longer time period at home. Just four controlled studies have examined the effect of SBOT on breathlessness when used at home during activities of daily living. Two studies, both included in our original review, examined quality of life in patients randomized to receive either home oxygen or air over a 12 week period. Eaton et al (2002), using a study population with significant exercise desaturation and providing light oxygen cylinders, did find an improvement in quality of life in patients who had been receiving oxygen. Interestingly, 41% of patients who had had a response to oxygen declined to use it after the study, citing poor acceptability or tolerability. McDonald et al (1995) recruited patients who desaturated less on exercise and supplied heavier oxygen cylinders; they found no improvement in quality of life. In a more recent study, Eaton et al (2006) randomized 78 patients discharged after an acute exacerbation to cylinder oxygen, cylinder air or usual care. There were no significant differences between the groups in quality of life, breathlessness or acute healthcare utilization. Nonoyama et al (2007), in an interesting study incorporating multiple N-of-1 RCTs for each of 27 patients, also found no evidence to support the use of long-term ambulatory oxygen therapy for patients who do not qualify for LTOT.

PMC2528206_34	"Importantly, no studies have been able to find factors that can predict which patients are likely to experience symptom relief from supplemental oxygen. Furthermore, Eaton et al (2002) found that an acute response to oxygen did not predict those that would benefit when using longer-term oxygen. Response to oxygen does not correlate with the extent of dyspnea at rest, level of hypoxemia at rest, degree of desaturation on exercise, or any tests of lung function. The response to oxygen is extremely variable between individuals, although more reproducible on an individual level (Waterhouse and Howard 1983). The only way to select the patients who will benefit from oxygen therapy is to undertake an individual clinical assessment. At its most rigorous, the undertaking an N-of-1 RCT has been described and recommended (Bruera et al 1992; Uronis et al 2006).

PMC2528206_35	"The burdens of oxygen therapy are considerable (Spathis et al 2006). A degree of psychological dependence is inevitable, and some patients become acutely anxious during even a short interruption in oxygen supply. Cumbersome, heavy equipment may restrict movement and activities within the home and limit excursions outside. Use of an oxygen mask may impair communication between a patient and family. Some patients feel a sense of social stigma and embarrassment, which may further hinder interaction and lead to isolation. Other issues include its combustibility, its considerable cost being, and the uncomfortable drying of airways including the nasal mucosa.
"	
PMC2528206_36	"Overall, therefore, there is little evidence to support the use of oxygen in palliating dyspnea. Although single assessment studies appear to show benefit from oxygen during exercise, these findings are not reproduced when oxygen is used longer-term during activities of daily living. Despite this lack of evidence of benefit, breathless patients approaching the end of life are often commenced on oxygen. Abernethy et al (2005) found in an email survey that 58% of surveyed palliative care and respiratory physicians believe that patients benefit from palliative oxygen. Given the negative aspects of oxygen therapy, it is likely that during end of life care, the burdens of oxygen therapy may well outweigh the benefits in a significant proportion of patients.

PMC2528206_37	"Withdrawal of oxygen therapy is, of course, not easy. It can cause distress, feelings of abandonment and fear that life may be shortened. Through careful and sensitive communication, patients may be helped to understand the lack of evidence for benefit from SOBT, the inevitable development of psychological dependence, the burdens of oxygen therapy and the lack of selection criteria to determine who may benefit. With individual clinical assessment, the few individuals who may benefit from SBOT can be identified.

PMC2528206_38	"There is good evidence that exercise is one of the most successful non-pharmacological approaches to managing breathlessness. Reconditioning is central to the benefit provided by pulmonary rehabilitation programs (Lacasse et al 2006). In the end of life phase capacity for exercise reduces, and the four most common approaches are use of a fan, energy conserving measures, breathing techniques and relaxation strategies.

PMC2528206_39	"The flow of cool air through the nose, mouth or over the cheek can reduce the perception of dyspnea (Schwartzstein et al 1987; Liss and Grant 1988). It is believed that stimulation of nasal or pharyngeal mucosal receptors or facial receptors in the region of the trigeminal nerve leads to afferent information being projected to the sensory cortex where it alters the central perception of dyspnea. There is extensive anecdotal evidence that patients find benefit from use of a fan, or from standing by an open window. Even with end-stage disease, patients find a small hand-held fan easy to use. It is a cheap piece of equipment that, unlike use of oxygen does not draw untoward attention to its user, and has no adverse effects. Interestingly, Booth et al (1996), in a study of cancer patients who were breathless at rest, found that both cylinder air and cylinder oxygen improve breathlessness, without there being a statistically significant difference between them. It may be that some of the benefit that patients perceive from oxygen may simply be due to it being a flow of cool gas. There is, to date, only a small amount of research evidence examining the use of a fan (Booth et al 2006); further studies are known to be underway.

PMC2528206_4	"The challenge for providers of generalist palliative care is particularly great when caring for those with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is the fourth leading cause of mortality worldwide, and compared to chronic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, mortality from COPD continues to rise (NIH 2003; WHO 2003). Its sufferers have extensive end of life needs. Death tends to occur after a prolonged functional decline associated with a heavy symptom load, emotional distress and social isolation. The quality of life of COPD patients appears to be at least as poor, and indeed may be worse than that of patients with lung cancer (Gore et al 2000; Edmonds et al 2001). There is a growing body of evidence that existing service provision is unable to meet these needs (Heffner et al 1996; Claessens et al 2000; Jones et al 2004; Elkington et al 2005; Au et al 2006). The emphasis appears to be on reactive crisis intervention at the time of acute exacerbations, rather than continual supportive care (Skilbeck et al 1998).

PMC2528206_41	"Breathing techniques improve the mechanical efficiency of respiration. They also lower the demand for ventilation by reducing dynamic hyperinflation, which in turn increases tidal volume and improves carbon dioxide elimination (Belman et al 1996; ODonnell et al 2001). The aim of these techniques is to reduce respiratory rate and prolong expiration, while using a gently leaning forward posture that improves the mechanical efficiency of the diaphragm. Several studies confirm the benefit of pursed-lips breathing on dyspnea (Tiep et al 1986; Breslin 1992). Several step-by-step exercises to alter breathing rhythm have been published (Gallo-Silver and Pollack 2000). Counting during the respiratory cycle has been advocated, such as a count of 4 during inhalation, of 7 during exhalation and a count to 2 before recommencing inhalation. Such breathing patterns need practice until they become unconscious and automatic. It is hard to learn such techniques close to the end of life, and is therefore important to teach patients early.

PMC2528206_42	"Relaxation techniques and training in anxiety reduction are particularly important with advanced disease. Anxiety increases breathlessness, which in turn contributes to the anxiety, leading to a deteriorating vicious circle (Bailey 2004). Various methods have been described, and techniques should be tailored and adapted for each individual. Methods include progressive muscular relaxation with systematic tensing and relaxing of all muscle groups, visualization and guided imagery, self-hypnosis and distraction by music (Walker 2004; Carrieri-Kohlman 2006). Renfroe (1988) found that taught relaxation techniques in ten COPD patients reduced anxiety more than in a control group that were told to relax without specific instructions. However, benefits were not maintained after the study, a finding confirmed in other studies (Gift et al 1992). Again this supports the view that such techniques should be continually practiced and should be taught well before the end of life phase in order to be of use when need arises.

There was no evidence of benefit from nebulized opioids. Thirteen of the eighteen included studies involved patients with COPD. There was more nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness and constipation in patients taking opioids compare to placebo. No deaths in any of the studies were attributed to opioids. Out of four studies that measured arterial blood gas tensions, in one study there was a statistically significant rise in pCO2 in patients on dihydrocodeine. However, in no instance did the PaCO2 rise above 5.3kPa, or the PaO2 fall significantly. Amongst the nine studies that measured oxygen saturation, none reported a significant change in patients on opioids.

PMC2528206_46	"There is no evidence to date that the doses of opioids used to palliate breathlessness causes clinically detectable respiratory depression or increased mortality (Mazzocato et al 1999; Jennings et al 2002). Why, then, is this beneficial therapy so commonly withheld on grounds of safety? The answer lies in the form of a deep societal misconception. The idea that opioids may kill when used for symptom control entered UK society in 1957 when Dr Bodkin Adams used the doctrine of double effect (DDE) as defense when accused of murdering an elderly lady from whose will he was to benefit. Since then this defense has been reused to the extent that unintended death from opioids used for symptom control has now become the classic example of DDE in clinical practice (George and Regnard 2007). This misconception seems to be entrenched, even in the face of lack of evidence. Interestingly, when opioids are given after withdrawing ventilator support in intensive care patients they not only do not hasten death, but may even enable breathing to continue longer after ventilator withdrawal (Chan et al 2004).

The anxiolytic, buspirone is of potential interest as it is a respiratory stimulant.

This focus on crisis intervention has led to a fragmented, reactive service rather than a supportive, preventative one (Brumley 2002). This is a major cause of the existing inadequacies in care for patients with advanced COPD.

PMC2528206_86	"The traditional model of care of patients with advanced disease, including COPD, is based on a dichotomy involving an abrupt transition from active, life-sustaining care to palliative care. This model does not work for patients with COPD for several reasons. First, as previously discussed, the timing of death is unpredictable, and it will always be hard to judge when the transition should be made. Second, patients with far advanced disease should not necessarily be denied active interventions such as ventilatory support during an acute exacerbation. Finally, COPD patients often live with a heavy burden of uncontrolled symptoms and psychosocial needs for a relatively long time, compared to patients with other diseases such as cancer; it would be unethical to deny such patients good palliation because they are not yet in the end of life phase.

A disease-orientated approach is inextricably linked with perceptions of failure as patients deteriorate, whereas a patient-centered approach aims for success in optimizing patients quality of life. Patient-centered care includes user involvement, and incorporates the views of patients into service design (Blackler et al 2004). Patients with advanced COPD, often isolated by immobility, require community-based care with continuity of care during hospitalisation (Elkington et al 2005). This can only be achieved with a coordinated, collaborative, multidisciplinary service (Brumley 2002). Service development must reflect the trajectory of advanced COPD, integrating rapid intervention during acute exacerbations with education on self-care and planning for unexpected death (Dy and Lynn 2007).

The LCP is an integrated care pathway that prompts, provides guidance on, and documents appropriate care in the terminal phase, for patients with all advanced diseases in all settings (Ellershaw and Ward 2003). It incorporates advice on the use of drugs to control symptoms in the last few days of life. The GSF is a primary care-based system that improves the quality of care by empowering generalists to provide evidence-based best practice including good communication, symptom control, out-of-hours care and carer support. In the UK, over a third of the population are cared for by general practices that have adopted the framework (Munday and Dale 2007; Thomas and Noble 2007). The PPC document can trigger and facilitate advance care planning conversations.

This disease process is manifest by progressive airflow limitation, hyperinflation and air trapping, hypoxemia, hypercapnea, and elevations in pulmonary vascular pressures. Clinically, individuals with COPD develop breathlessness, cough, sputum production and disease exacerbations that impair quality of life. Factors that portend a poor prognosis include severity of airflow limitation, ventilatory capacity, hypercapnea, and pulmonary hypertension (Burrows and Earle 1969; Weitzenblum et al 1981; Anthonisen et al 1986). Survival correlates negatively with pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance and patients with COPD and PH have increased morbidity and risk for hospitalizations for acute COPD exacerbations (Burrows et al 1972; Weitzenblum et al 1984; Kessler et al 1999; Barbera et al 2003).

PMC2528217_20	"In 1965, Hicken et al (1965) described the histopathologic changes in the pulmonary vasculature of patients with chronic bronchitis or emphysema and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. They noted a circular layer of smooth muscle in the media of the pulmonary arterioles that was not present in the smaller pulmonary arteries. Both the pulmonary arterioles and small pulmonary arteries had a layer of longitudinal smooth muscle beneath the internal elastic lamina but neither one of the vessels had significant intimal fibrosis. Because these vascular changes were similar to the alterations reported in PH associated with high altitude, Hicken et al (1965) hypothesized that PH associated with hypoxic lung diseases such as COPD was caused solely by hypoxic vasoconstriction and arteriolar muscular hyperplasia. Subsequent observations that high altitude PH resolves after descent to lower altitudes (Grover et al 1996) suggested that PH associated with COPD might reverse with correction of hypoxemia. Contrary to the expected result, pulmonary pressures decreased but did not normalize in individuals with PH associated with COPD who were treated with supplemental oxygen therapy (Abraham et al 1968). Subsequent studies of acute and chronic oxygen therapy in patients with COPD also failed to show resolution of PH (Lejeune et al 1984; Timms et al 1985). These physiologic findings suggested that the PH associated with COPD that persists after correction of hypoxemia is due to fixed vascular remodeling and spurred further, more detailed histopathological studies (Wilkinson et al 1988; Peinado et al 1999; Hale et al 1980). In 1988, Wilkinson (Wilkinson et al 1988) observed similar histopathologic findings in lung tissue from 10 patients with hypoxic cor pulmonale and COPD regardless of treatment with supplemental oxygen. The media of the muscular pulmonary arteries was normal or atrophic but the intima revealed an active deposition of longitudinal muscle, fibrosis and elastosis. The media of the normally poorly muscularized arterioles revealed a circular muscular coat bounded by a new internal elastic lamina. Luminal narrowing was present with frequent recanalization of the arteriolar lumen (Wilkinson et al 1988). Subsequent studies of lung tissue from individuals with moderate to severe COPD have consistently reported similar findings (Wright et al 1983; Hale et al 1984; Wright et al 1992). Interestingly, when lung sections from smokers with COPD were compared with non-smokers, the density of the fully muscularized (0300 m diameter) pulmonary arteries and the thickness of the medial muscle layer was doubled and the depth of intimal fibrosis was tripled (Hale et al 1984). This intimal thickening is due to both smooth muscle cell proliferation and increased elastin and collagen deposition (Santos et al 2002).

The degree of intimal thickening correlates with the severity of small airways disease and emphysema (Hale et al 1980).

The severity of vascular abnormalities does not correlate directly with the pulmonary pressure at rest (Wilkinson et al 1988; Wright et al 1992).

Although the effect of recurrent, transient episodes of hypoxia in the development of pulmonary vascular dysfunction is unclear, chronic hypoxia has been studied extensively and is a known cause of PH (Heath et al 1973; Thompson et al 1989; Vender 1994; Reeves and Grover 2005). The pathophysiologic mechanisms of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction are not fully understood but are believed due to direct and indirect effects of lowered oxygen levels on the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells (Hida et al 2002). The direct action occurs through potassium and calcium channels (Weir and Archer 1995). In the presence of hypoxia, potassium channels within pulmonary smooth muscle cells close causing membrane depolarization and an influx of calcium, stimulating smooth muscle cell contraction (Weir and Archer 1995). Hypoxia may also act indirectly on the pulmonary vasculature by stimulating the production of transcription factors (Yan et al 1998; Mechtcheriakova et al 1999) such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (Semenza 2000; Yu et al 1998)and the release of multiple endogenous mediators including angiotensin II (Morrell et al 1995), endothelin-1 (Chen et al 1995; DiCarlo et al 1995; Elton etal 1992; Hu et al 1998), and growth factors (Mechtcheriakova et al 1999; Santos et al 2003).

Once an individual quits smoking, resumption of cigarettes should be continually discouraged as there is a steeper rate of decline in FEV1 in patients who restart smoking than in those who smoke without interruption (Sherrill et al 1996).

PMC2528217_42	"Correction of hypoxemia with supplemental oxygen is also recommended therapy for patients with COPD and PH. Long term oxygen therapy is recommended for patients with COPD whose resting PaO2 is <55 mmHg or is between 56 and 59 mmHg during rest, sleep, or exertion and who have clinical evidence of cor pulmonale or polycythemia (Celli et al 2004). Long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival in hypoxic COPD patients and is associated with a mild improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics (Medical Research Council Working Party 1981; Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Group 1980). Additionally, supplemental oxygen during exercise decreases PAP (Burrows et al 1972; Fujimoto et al 2002), increases exercise tolerance (Fujimoto et al 2002) and improves RV function (Olvey et al 1980). Pulmonary pressures are known to increase with sleep in patients with COPD associated PH (Raeside et al 2002). Acutely, oxygen therapy abolishes this nocturnal rise in pulmonary pressures (Raeside et al 2002). Long term nocturnal oxygen decreases pulmonary pressures in patients with moderate to severe COPD, PH, and daytime PaO2 >60 mmHg but who experience nocturnal desaturation (Fletcher et al 1992). A 3 year randomized trial involving 51 patients with moderate to severe COPD and PH demonstrated that patients with nocturnal desaturation treated with supplemental oxygen experienced a 3.7 mm Hg decrease in PAP whereas those patients with nocturnal desaturation who were treated with room air experienced a 3.9 mm Hg increase in PAP (Fletcher et al 1992). LTOT also ameliorates the progression of COPD associated PH. In 1985, Weitzenblum and colleagues (Weitzenblum et al 1985) evaluated the progression of COPD associated PH before and after 24 years of LTOT. Prior to LTOT, the PAP increased by approximately 1.47  2.3 mmHg per year whereas the PAP decreased by 2.15  4.4 mmHg per year with oxygen therapy. Despite the beneficial effects of oxygen therapy in patients with hypoxemia and COPD, LTOT does not lead to the normalization of pulmonary pressures (Abraham et al 1968) or the reversal of morphologic derangements in the pulmonary vasculature (Wilkinson et al 1988). Therefore, additional interventions are needed to treat the fixed vascular remodeling in COPD associated PH.

Severe PH in patients with COPD reduces median survival by approximately 40 months (Chaouat et al 2005). The pathogenesis of PH associated with COPD has not been clearly elucidated but is likely due to the combined effects of inflammation (Peinado et al 1999), endothelial cell dysfunction (Dinh-Xuan et al 1991; Peinado et al 1998), and angiogenesis (Santos et al 2003) that lead to intimal thickening, luminal narrowing, and arteriolar muscularization (Barbera et al 1994; Peinado et al 1998; Magee et al 1988; Hale et al 1980).

This is accompanied by a reduction in the number of hospital or ICU days compared to standard medical care only, which in particular might include intubation. The results make sense in view of the fact that non-invasive ventilation offers significant advantages over invasive approaches, circumventing a number of serious complications that can occur after tracheal tube insertion or tracheostomy.

Another key indicator of failure seems to be the lack of improvement in clinical and gas exchange measures within the first hour after initiation of NPPV (Garpestad et al 2007). There are further predictors for NPPV failure that have been revealed during the last years and might be helpful for the decision on initiation and continuation of NPPV in patients with COPD and ARF (Table 1).

In controlled ventilation, a reduction of inspiratory time and respiratory frequency can increase expiratory time thus promoting lung deflation with the consequence of a reduction in PEEPi (Ward et al 2008).

Despite these uncertainties, COPD with concomitant chronic hyper-capnic respiratory failure has become one of the major indications for home mechanical ventilation (HMV), at least in Europe (Janssens et al 2003; Lloyd-Owen et al 2005). The large variability in prescription rates among different countries and institutions probably reflects the fact that the criteria for initiating home ventilation in these patients differ, similarly to the conditions and traditions of health care systems. Throughout countries, home ventilation is predominantly administered through a nasal or facial mask during the night; only a minority of patients is ventilated invasively via tracheostoma (Farre et al 2005). Recent data indicate that invasive ventilation is associated with poorer long-term outcome particularly in patients with COPD (Marchese et al 2008).

Noteworthy enough there seems to be no agreement on the required levels of hypercapnia, and these have never been verified in comparative, prospective, randomized controlled trials. As a mark for orientation, the indication for non-invasive home ventilation in COPD is often based on the statements of a Consensus Conference Report a number of years ago (Consensus Conference Report 1999). According to these, home mechanical ventilation can be justified in severe COPD after optimization of standard therapy including LTOT, if daytime PaCO2 levels during spontaneous breathing are at least 55 mmHg. The same applies if PaCO2 levels are lower (5054 mmHg) but at the same time significant nocturnal hypoventilation is present (Table 3).

Thus, in more mild hypercapnia (PaCO2 5054 mmHg) a further indication for home ventilation in COPD might be that at least two episodes of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure per year occur (Consensus Conference Report 1999). Such considerations suggest a role for HMV beyond the reversal of chronic hypercapnia as an immediate target.

PMC2650592_26	"According to the current view, COPD is considered as a systemic, multidimensional disorder bearing a variety of risk factors for severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization (Garcia-Aymerich et al 2001; Kessler et al 1999) and for death from different causes (Dolan et al 2005). These risk factors favor disease instability, uncompensated respiratory failure, and as a consequence hospitalization and death. A recent comprehensive meta-analysis came to the conclusion that in severe COPD HMV is capable of evoking beneficial effects on the ventilatory pattern, thereby reducing the work of breathing and improving functional reserves (Kolodziej et al 2007). Correspondingly, the use of NPPV at home might be one important factor in counteracting episodes of impending respiratory failure, which in these multi-morbid patients easily result from exacerbations. Thus there seems to be enough reason for arguing that the eligibility for HMV should not be based on a too restrictive and simple pattern of criteria. Preferentially it should rely on a rational analysis of the individual patients risk factor profile (Table 3). Such a view is also suggested by the results of a recent large observational study (Budweiser et al 2007b).

PMC2650592_27	"Moreover, a non-controlled investigation suggested that the continuation of HMV after difficult or prolonged weaning was associated with better long-term survival, compared to patients discharged without ventilatory support. Interestingly enough, this was independent from the patients age and duration of hospital stay (Quinnell et al 2006). Thus careful administration of HMV in patients with COPD is not only likely to exert beneficial effects on the patients but also might be beneficial for the society, as it can result in a significantly lower frequency of hospital admissions and a concomitant reduction in health-care costs, as noted previously (Casanova et al 2000; Jones et al 1998; Tuggey et al 2003). Whether this will lead to reduced or balanced overall costs, still has to be checked in prospective randomized controlled trials. Recent observational data suggest that long-term management of patients with severe COPD and chronic respiratory failure by measures including HMV does not increase healthcare costs compared to LTOT treatment alone (Clini et al 2008).

PMC2650592_28	"It might seem surprising that the knowledge on the mechanisms underlying the effects of non-invasive HMV, especially their relative contributions under different conditions, is still rather limited. In particular the basis for the improvement of gas exchange during spontaneous breathing after NPPV support has not been clarified in detail (Mehta et al 2001). The hypothesis  plausible at the first sight  that non-invasive ventilation primarily allows the exhausted respiratory muscles to rest and recover probably not properly accounts for the complex mechanisms involved (Budweiser et al 2008b). This is true despite the fact that ventilatory support can be associated with a reduction in the activation of respiratory muscles under certain circumstances, as shown in earlier studies (Carrey et al 1990; Nava et al 1993; Renston et al 1994).

PMC2650592_29	"However, restoration of chemosensitivity (Mehta et al 2001) and changes in ventilatory pattern including an increase in tidal and minute volumes, as well as the concomitant reduction of respiratory frequency, may play a more prominent role in long-term NPPV. The relevance of these factors has been demonstrated in sophisticated physiological studies (Ambrosino et al 1992; Diaz et al 2002; Diaz et al 2005b). Even more important seems to be that the amelioration of the ventilatory pattern is preserved during spontaneous breathing (Ambrosino et al 1992; Diaz et al 2002; Diaz et al 2005b). This could well underlie the sustained reduction of PaCO2, which again induces positive effects on lung hyper-inflation and respiratory muscles (Budweiser et al 2005; Diaz et al 2002).

The latter has recently been validated especially with regard to COPD and HMV (Windisch et al 2008).

PMC2650592_36	"One of the most important factors for a success of NPPV, especially a marked reduction in PaCO2, appears to be the achievement of effective ventilation by applying sufficient levels of inspiratory pressure. In accordance with this, studies capable of demonstrating beneficial effects of NPPV on gas exchange, lung function, sleep, or health-related quality of life (Budweiser et al 2005; Budweiser et al 2007c; Meecham Jones et al 1995; Windisch et al 2005) all used high inspiratory pressures, up to 28 cm H2O, which were still well tolerated by the patients. In contrast, the application of lower inspiratory pressure levels (1015 cm H2O), as chosen in the two available randomized controlled trials (Casanova et al 2000; Clini et al 2002), was associated with an unfavorable outcome. Though these parallels are not compelling, they are at least suggestive.

To allow for maximal expiratory emptying of the lung, inspiratory time should be chosen as short as possible when using controlled ventilation modes, with a target ratio of inspiration to expiration time (I:E) of at least 1:2 to 1:3.

PMC2650592_38	"Taking well-chosen ventilator settings and the usage of modern, sophisticated ventilators for granted, the potential of non-invasive ventilation can be fully utilized only if patients are motivated, well instructed and encouraged.

For achieving this, the availability of an experienced team as well as sufficient time for familiarization within an in-patient setting appears of utmost value. Today the high rates of inacceptance as reported in the early years of HMV (Lin 1996; Strumpf et al 1991) would not be considered acceptable and justified by objective reasons. Of course, contraindications have still to be taken into account (Table 2).

In contrast, ventilatory pump failure (type II (hypercapnic) respiratory failure) is caused by mechanical disadvantage (such as lung hyperinflation in COPD), central nervous system abnormalities, or respiratory muscle dysfunction and leads to an elevation of PaCO2 levels, often in company with hypoxemia due to alveolar hypoventilation.

More promising seems the addition of a helium-oxygen mixture based on the fluid-mechanical and physiological properties of helium.

In addition to ventilation/perfusion inhomogeneities, lung hyperinflation is a major factor in the pathogenesis of hypercapnic respiratory failure, being associated with a flat diaphragm and thereby diminishing muscle efficiency and increasing energy consumption (Calverley 2003). In the chronic setting, patients with COPD often show a rapid shallow breathing. This presumably represents a key protective mechanism to prevent respiratory muscle fatigue, however at the price of an insufficient alveolar ventilation (Roussos et al 2003). In severe COPD with markedly limited functional reserves, acute-on-chronic respiratory failure may aggravate the pre-existing chronic respiratory failure. This can happen when an acute deterioration of whatsoever origin, most often increased airway obstruction during acute exacerbation, poses an additional load on the respiratory system. The pre-existing mechanical disadvantage is further boosted by incomplete emptying of the lungs, leading to air trapping. This promotes a significant intrinsic positive end-expiratory airway pressure (PEEPi) which further aggravates respiratory muscle dysfunction and enhances ventilation-perfusion mismatch (Smith et al 1988).

Similarly, the rationale for administering supplemental oxygen during sleep in patients showing only nocturnal desaturations has not yet been clearly supported by data.

This causes progressive asphyxia, which increasingly stimulates breathing efforts against the collapsed airway, typically until the person is awakened (Wiegand and Zwillich 1994). Various factors, ranging from upper airway anatomy to central respiratory control mechanisms, interact to produce the clinical syndrome of OSAS. The primary defect is probably an anatomically small or collapsible pharyngeal airway, in combination with a sleep-induced fall in upper airway muscle activity (Liistro 2002; Fogel et al 2004). One or more of these variables, which conspire to cause upper airway obstruction (Hudgel 1992; Badr 1999), may affect any given OSAS patient.

The role of this reduction in chemical drives is still under discussion. It is not clear whether it is an inherited abnormality in ventilatory control (El Bayadi et al 1990; Redline et al 1997), or secondary to sleep apnea as suggested by the improvement in ventilatory response to CO2 in hypercapnic OSAS patients after CPAP therapy (Berthon-Jones and Sullivan 1987; Lin 1994). Lin studied six patients with hypercapnic OSAS and 24 patients with eucapnic OSAS.

PMC2650593_21	"It is known that overlap patients present more nocturnal desaturation than patients with either OSAS or COPD alone (Chaouat et al 1995; Sanders et al 2003). Sanders and colleagues (2003) examined the degree to which COPD and OSAS independently and jointly contribute to desaturation during sleep. After adjusting for confounding factors, the odds ratio for nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation was considerably increased in OSAS patients. Bednarek and colleagues (2005) compared polysomnographic variables between overlap syndrome and OSAS subjects. The overlap syndrome group had lower mean arterial blood saturation and spent more time in desaturation than the OSAS group. Radwan and colleagues (1995) compared the breathing pattern and CO2 response in 11 obese male overlap syndrome patients, 20 obese male OSAS patients with normal lung function, and 13 healthy nonobese controls. Overlap patients had a higher breathing frequency and lower tidal volume than OSAS patients. The OSAS group presented similar values to controls in ventilatory response to CO2 and occlusion pressure responses. This author concludes that overlap patients with hypercapnia have both blunted ventilatory responses and mouth occlusion pressure responses to CO2 (Radwan et al 1995) and that ventilatory response may be disturbed by lung mechanics and gas exchange. In subjects with chronic hypercapnia, there is an increased blood bicarbonate concentration, which may inhibit CO2 sensitivity and decreases mouth occlusion pressure response (Radwan et al 1995). Other authors have postulated that hyperinflation of the lung may also decrease mouth occlusion pressure response (Erbland et al 1990).

The prevalence of overlap syndrome is very different depending on the definition used. Some of the apparent discrepancies between studies can be explained by differences in selection criteria, population characteristics and design (Table 2). In early studies, a high prevalence of OSAS was found in individuals with COPD. Guilleminault and colleagues (1980) studied 26 COPD patients while sleeping and found that 92% of all abnormal respiratory events during sleep contained an obstructive component. Chaouat and colleagues (1995) prospectively investigated 265 OSAS patients and reported that 11% had an obstructive spirographic pattern. Resta and colleagues (2000) retrospectively evaluated data from 213 consecutive patients referred to the Sleep Laboratory, and found that 16% had overlap syndrome. De Miguel and colleagues (2002) found a 28.5% prevalence of overlap in a group of patients referred to the hospital. However, this high prevalence could well be due to a selection bias. Nevertheless, a very large study including 5,954 participants done in conjunction with the Sleep Heart Health Study, did not find significant differences in the prevalence of OSAS among COPD subjects (14.0%) and those without COPD (18.6%) (Sanders et al 2003).

A wide range of commercially available analyzers exist, which decreases the cost of individual measurements. Persistent generation of oxygen radicals in the body leads to the formation of other compounds, which can also be measured from the exhaled air; these include carbon monoxide (CO) which is formed by enzymatic degradation of heme aic degradation of heme aic degradation of heme aic degradation of heme aic degradation of heme aic degradation of heme and nonheme-related release (Kharitonov and Barnes 2001b) and hydrocarbons such as volatile organic compounds (VOC), which are nonspecific markers of lipid peroxidation (Kneepkens et al 1994). The activation of inflammatory cells, including macrophages, eosinophils, and neutrophils, results in increased production of O2 and the subsequent formation of H2O2.

Dilution of EBC can be corrected by measuring the level of urea and/or electrolytes derived from ELF. Other confounding factors include consumption of alcohol, diets with variable amounts of antioxidants, smoking, subclinical lung diseases which have not been clinically manifested, and differences in the collection of the samples and their storage. Significant salivary contamination can be excluded by measuring the amylase concentrations in samples (Kharitonov and Barnes 2001b), but uncertainty still exists with respect to the nasal contamination. Recommendations for EBC have been formulated by the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society task force, but these recommendations also emphasized the difficulties encountered in the sampling and analysis of EBC (Horvath et al 2005). To date the majority of the analyses conducted in EBC have involved spectrophotometry and enzyme immunoassays, as well as sophisticated analytical techniques such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Spin trapping is one of the most direct methods available for the assessment of highly reactive free radicals/oxidants. These latter techniques require special expertise and as far as we are aware, they have not been used for assaying EBC in clinical settings.

The processing of the sputum sample needs to be immediate and requires expertise and this significantly limits its use in routine clinical practice. Sampling cannot be repeated within a short period of time, and the technique itself may induce an inflammatory response, which may persist for 24 h (Nightingale et al 1998; Holz et al 1998). Contamination of sputum samples by saliva may lead to reduced mediator concentrations, although differential cell counts remain relatively unchanged (Simpson et al 2004). On the other hand, several markers are relatively similar in the induced sputum and BAL and the technique of collecting induced sputum is much less invasive than fibreoptic bronchoscopy (Fahy et al 1995b). Overall, induced sputum is a standardized method and recommendations for sputum induction have been formulated by a European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society task force (Djukanovic et al 2002). Induced sputum and its processing do require expertise that may be available in specialized centers though its use in a primary care setting would be demanding.

PMC2650600_15	"Bronchoalveolar lavage has the advantage of sampling the distal airways and alveoli in the lung periphery (Kelly et al 1987). However, BAL is more invasive than the above-mentioned procedures and has also several other limitations. The invasiveness of BAL limits its clinical application in assessing airway inflammation in asthma and COPD. Generally, BAL has been performed safely on patients with stable COPD (Hattotuwa et al 2002). BAL is, however, risky to patients with moderate/severe lung disease, acute exacerbations of airway disease and also is unsuitable for children. It is also associated with sedation, impaired gas exchange and a risk of infections. Even though the BAL technique has also been standardized (Haslam and Baughman 1999), BAL fluid of COPD patients is often inadequate and not representative of the situation in the bronchioles due to airway collapse and reduced fluid recovery (Barnes et al 2006). Saline instillation into the lungs can lead to artefacts, ie, the dilution of the lavage may contribute to the variability of measurements. BAL cannot be recommended for the diagnosis or follow-up of the patients with asthma or COPD.

FeNO levels correlate with eosinophilic airway inflammation and predict a decline in asthma control when repeated as longitudinal measurements (Kharitonov and Barnes 2001a; Liu and Thomas 2005; Smith et al 2005). The changes in serial FeNO have a higher predictive value than single measurements (Jatakanon et al 2000; Leuppi et al 2001; Kharitonov and Barnes 2001a). In addition, the level of FeNO is related to several markers of asthma control, such as asthma symptoms, dyspnea score, daily use of rescue medication, and reversibility of airflow obstruction (Sippel et al 2000). Elevated FeNO levels can be detected before one can determine any significant deterioration in airway hyperresponsiveness, elevation of sputum eosinophil levels or changes in lung function parameters (Kharitonov et al 1996b; Jatakanon et al 2000). The main site of origin of the increased levels of FeNO in asthma is the lower airways (Kharitonov et al 1996a). The measurement is highly reproducible both in healthy and asthmatic adults and children (Kharitonov et al 2003). Measurements of exhaled NO at different flows show that the increase in peripheral NO is often related to disease severity (Brindicci et al 2005). Overall FeNO is one of the most widely used biomarkers in the diagnosis of asthma especially when the diagnosis is uncertain; recent results clearly highlight its benefits also in asthma management.

On the other hand, FeNO levels are generally decreased in smokers (Maziak et al 1998; Rytila et al 2006). There is also some disagreement on whether changes in serial FeNO are significant evidence of loss of asthma control or simply due to errors in measurements or the natural variability of airway inflammation over time (Kharitonov 2004). This suggests that FeNO may not always be related to asthma severity or airway inflammation (Kharitonov and Barnes 2000). Development of less expensive FeNO analyzers would be beneficial, since for now FeNO analyzers are available mostly in central/university hospitals. Despite these problems, FeNO measurements have remained as one of the most important parameters in evaluating, treating, and monitoring patients with asthma and airway disease with eosinophilic inflammation.

FeNO levels increase during COPD exacerbation (Maziak et al 1998), most likely due to increased oxidative stress especially in cases with coexistent asthma and/or the presence of airway eosinophils (Papi et al 2000). The elevated levels of FeNO in unstable COPD compared both with stable smokers or ex-smokers with COPD are attributable to the presence of eosinophils (Maziak et al 1998). On the other hand, cigarette smoke decreases FeNO levels (Kharitonov et al 1995; Robbins et al 1996) by down-regulating eNOS (Su et al 1998) and consuming NO, making FeNO an unreliable marker for the diagnosis of asthma in smokers.

Airway inflammation is present in all forms of asthma, even in mild (Battaglia et al 2005) and asymptomatic cases (Bousquet et al 2000; Montuschi et al 2004) and it can be detected in both central and peripheral airways (Hamid et al 1997) in asthma. There is a strong association between fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and skin prick test scores, total immunoglobulin E (IgE) (Ho et al 2000) and blood eosinophilia (Silvestri et al 1999). In contrast, COPD is a disease characterized by airway inflammation with neutrophil predominance (Bosken et al 1992), and periods of acute exacerbations (Fletcher and Peto 1977) with further increased airway inflammation and worsening of lung function (Gompertz et al 2001). Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for development of COPD, and smoking cessation is at present the only effective way to slow down the disease progression (Culpitt and Rogers 2000; Scanlon et al 2000). COPD exacerbations are often triggered by viral or bacterial infections consisting not only of increased numbers of neutrophils, but also of eosinophils and activated macrophages in the airways (Rahman and MacNee 2000; Saetta et al 2001). Neutrophil accumulation on the other hand is one typical feature that is seen in asthma exacerbation (Fahy et al 1995a; Kim et al 2000). There is overlap not only in the inflammatory profile but also in the oxidant markers, especially in acute asthma and COPD exacerbations. The present review focuses on oxidant markers, but the numbers of certain inflammatory cells and the levels of cytokines have also been found to be significantly correlated with oxidant markers in the airways of patients with asthma and COPD.

However, even though both HPLC and GC/MS measurements are sensitive and detect similar nitrotyrosine levels in the EBC, they do not differentiate healthy controls from asthmatics, and therefore nitrotyrosine does not seem to be a selective marker for oxidative stress in asthma (Celio et al 2006).

Overall, the increase of the S-nitrosothiols in EBC is transitory, and probably not sensitive enough to help in the diagnostic assessment of airway diseases.

Approximately 85% of CO is exhaled (Kharitonov and Barnes 2001b; Barnes et al 2006). Many pathological conditions in addition to airway inflammation, can contribute to CO formation. One major limitation of exhaled CO in assessing oxidative stress in asthma or COPD is the marked effects of smoking on CO concentrations. The levels of exhaled CO are elevated in stable asthma and become reduced towards the normal values by administration of inhaled corticosteroids (Zayasu et al 1997; Horvath et al 1998; Barnes et al 2006). The effects of smoking make the assessment of exhaled CO in COPD difficult. Exhaled CO can be measured by electrochemical sensors, laser spectrophotometry, and by an infrared CO analysis as well as by gas chromatography, methods that are widely available in clinical laboratories. The analysis of CO is straightforward but the levels of CO are too variable to be significant in the clinical assessment of asthma and COPD, their diagnosis, or follow-up.

Macrophages from healthy smokers release more H2O2 than the cells from nonsmokers (Baughman et al 1986; Nowak et al 1996; Guatura et al 2000). Exhaled H2O2 concentrations are higher in smoking than nonsmoking asthmatic patients or controls, though there is extensive variability (Horvath et al 2004). Acute smoking leads to a further elevation in exhaled H2O2 levels in asthmatic patients indicating that smoking causes an acute additional release of ROS in the airways (Horvath et al 2004). Since H2O2 evaporates readily due to its highly unstable nature and its concentration decreases after a few days of storage at 70 C, it needs to be assayed immediately (van Beurden et al 2002). One study claimed that EBC can be stored for up to 40 days without any loss of H2O2 concentration (van Beurden et al 2002). However, the variability of the H2O2 levels in airway fluids is high, generally the levels of H2O2 are low and the methods for H2O2 analysis are insensitive (Van Hoydonck et al 2004). There are different techniques, all with their own limitations for H2O2 detection and therefore meaningful comparison of the results from various laboratories is difficult (Van Hoydonck et al 2004). In summary, H2O2 is released from a number of cell types, it is relatively unstable, and its analysis is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to allow the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, or monitoring of asthma or COPD.

It is a stable metabolite and specific to lipid peroxidation (Janssen 2001; Morrow and Roberts 2002; Cracowski et al 2002). It has been proposed to represent an important tool for reliably exploring oxidative stress in lung diseases (Montuschi et al 2004). Moreover, dietary fats do not have any significant effect on the 8-isoprostane concentration (Gopaul et al 2000). Although antioxidants scavenge ROS, it seems that they fail to reduce the rate of lipid peroxidation (Anderson et al 1988; Habib et al 1999) possibly due to the fact that lipid peroxidation is the result of a complicated metabolic pathway, where only the first step is initiated by free radicals (Morrow et al 1990). Nevertheless several studies have indicated that 8-isoprostane may be an important mediator of oxidative stress and pulmonary oxygen toxicity (Janssen 2001) and form part of a common pathway leading to airflow obstruction (Paredi et al 2002).

The main location of iNOS, which is the most efficient of the NO synthases in producing NO during inflammation, is the airway epithelium, but it has also been detected in inflammatory cells (Barnes and Belvisi 1993). Although, the levels of iNOS have been found to be elevated in the induced sputum of asthmatics (Sugiura et al 2003), variable levels of iNOS have been reported in COPD patients (Ichinose et al 2000; Rytila et al 2006). EPO is elevated in asthma while MPO, which is expressed in neutrophils and monocytes (Kim et al 2001), is elevated in COPD with the levels being higher in COPD than in asthma (Metso et al 2001). A rather similar elevation in the number of MPO-positive cells is seen in the induced sputum of chronic nonsymptomatic smokers and chronic symptomatic smokers with normal lung function, who are considered to be at risk of developing COPD (Rytila et al 2006). Sputum MPO concentrations have been reported to be extremely variable in several investigations with large standard deviations (Kim et al 2001). However, EPO and MPO may possess potential significance in differentiating asthma from COPD. MPO leads to the formation of HOCl and EPO to HOBr. These markers still seem to offer the greatest potential in the differentiation of asthma and COPD but both of them have been evaluated in only a few investigations. In one study, the best results when determining the most optimal fixation procedure to detect MPO and EPO in cytocentrifuged cell samples (induced sputum, BAL) were obtained using a commercial reagent Ortho PermeaFix (OPF; Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ) for flow cytometry (Metso et al 2002a).

Abundant iNOS and nitrotyrosine positive sputum cells have also been seen in COPD patients compared to healthy smokers with a negative correlation to FEV1 (Ichinose et al 2000). However, the sputum samples of smokers without airway obstruction and also some samples of nonsmokers display increased levels of nitrotyrosine (Rytila et al 2006).

Since symptoms and lung function tests are indirect methods to assess the disease severity both in asthma and COPD, they may not reveal the extent of the underlying airway pathology.

It is hypothesized that the degree of formation of 4-HNE in response to smoking may also contribute to the development of enhanced airspace inflammation in COPD (Rahman et al 2002). 4-HNE can be detected in lung biopsies of COPD patients (Rahman et al 2002), but recently it has also been detected in induced sputum samples of chronic smokers, irrespective of the lung function parameters or symptoms compared to nonsmokers (Rytila et al 2006).

Enzymes related to GSH synthesis/homeostasis such as glutathione peroxidases (GPx) play an important role in the antioxidant defense of human lung (Cantin et al 1987). Extracellular glutathione peroxidase (eGPx) has not been investigated in sputum specimens but it is increased in the BALF of asthma patients (Comhair et al 2001). Glutaredoxins (GRX) participate in GSH binding to proteins and thiol oxidation/reduction, reactions that regulate the active forms of many thiol containing enzymes. GRX-1 is mainly expressed by macrophages (Peltoniemi et al 2004) and the levels are decreased in the sputum macrophages of COPD patients (Peltoniemi et al 2006). Glutathione-S-transferase omega, which has many functional features in common with GRX, has been recently found to be expressed mainly in alveolar macrophages, and similar to GRX-1, its levels also decline in COPD (Harju et al 2007). Catalase is expressed both in the inflammatory cells and alveolar epithelium, and it is inactivated at least in the murine model of asthma (Ghosh et al 2006). Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is an enzyme induced by oxidant stress (stress-response protein) and cytokines. It is expressed mainly in alveolar macrophages of human lung and macrophages of induced sputum of steroid-nave asthmatics show prominent but only transient HO-I immunoreactivity. This is not seen in asthmatics treated with corticosteroids (Harju et al 2002b). The expression of HO-1 is increased also in the sputum macrophages of COPD patients compared to healthy nonsmokers, but there is no difference between COPD patients and healthy smokers (Maestrelli et al 2001). Cigarette smoking increases especially the RNA expression of GSH-related enzymes in the bronchial brushings of healthy individuals (Hackett et al 2003), but the RNA levels of antioxidant enzymes in the bronchial epithelium have high variability in COPD depending on its severity (Pierrou et al 2007). Even though the above mentioned findings have not been confirmed in sputum, the results are interesting; they suggest that combined profiles of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes and their posttranslational modifications (such as oxidation, thiolation, S-nitrosylation) may be promising indicators of the severity of oxidative stress in human airways.

There are significant differences in the MMP profiles in COPD and asthma. In COPD, elevated levels of MMP1, 8, and 9 compared with asthmatics, nonsmokers, and non-symptomatic cigarette smokers have been reported, and these changes may also reflect the different pathogenesis of these diseases (Culpitt et al 2005). In the future, MMPs may be considered as additional biomarkers in COPD and/or asthma development.

The prevalence of active cigarette smoking among asthmatics is as common as it is in the general population, for example in Finland as many as 30% of asthmatics are smokers (Haahtela et al 2006). There is limited data on the airway pathology of smoking asthmatics, since these patients are frequently excluded from experimental studies. Asthma and cigarette smoking potentiate the effects of each other, leading to impaired asthma control, more severe symptoms (Althuis et al 1999), increased need for rescue medication (Gallefoss and Bakke 2003), accelerated deterioration of lung function (Lange et al 1998) and reduced short-term therapeutic response to corticosteroids (Chaudhuri et al 2003). Smoking may also modify the typical asthmatic inflammation profile, which complicates the differential diagnosis from COPD. It also appears that there are features of both accelerated and suppressed inflammatory responses in smokers with asthma. The number of eosinophils in sputum are decreased (Chalmers et al 2001), perhaps due to the exogenous NO in cigarette smoke increasing apoptosis of activated eosinophils (Assreuy et al 1993) whereas the number of neutrophils is elevated (Chalmers et al 2001). Many asthmatic smokers have mixed features of typical asthmatic and smoke-related airway inflammation and pathology. Results from clinical studies suggest that smokers with asthma may be resistant to therapeutic effects of the corticosteroids (Chalmers et al 2001; Chaudhuri et al 2003). There is also evidence that the time of initiation of smoking may influence the asthma phenotype: atopy-associated asthma has been shown to develop before smoking initiation (Raherison et al 2003). It has been claimed that the remodeling of airways might be more severe in asthmatic smokers (Carroll et al 2000). Several markers of oxidative/nitrosative stress are increased even in healthy smokers, but we are not aware of any studies where the oxidant markers have been compared between healthy smokers and smoking asthmatics. It is apparent that the sensitivity of FeNO to detect a worsening of asthmatic inflammation in smokers is poor, since smoking on its own decreases FeNO levels significantly.

The symptoms do not closely reflect spirometric changes and the symptoms may predict exacerbation only in some individuals (Seemungal et al 2000). COPD exacerbations in turn are important events in terms of disease progression, morbidity, and mortality. Many patients with COPD never recover completely from the exacerbation. The lung pathology is especially complex in COPD as the disease contains many phenotypes displaying a wide variety of airway and emphysematous changes. However, all phenotypes are treated similarly, because there are no specific biomarkers for the differentiation of the disease subtypes or their progression. At present, no biomarker in clinical practice is able to differentiate small airway inflammation and fibrosis from alveolar destruction even though these changes are the main pathophysiologic events in COPD (Barnes et al 2006). Special efforts should be directed towards finding reliable biomarkers that would differentiate the phenotypes of COPD in addition to identifying markers that can be used in the assessment of disease progression. Though outside the scope of this review, which concentrates on local airway biomarkers, a number of biomarkers in the circulating blood/plasma and in the skeletal muscle are under intensive investigation as ways of monitoring the progression of COPD (Aldonyte et al 2004; Gosker et al 2005; Hurst et al 2006; Jones and Agusti 2006).

PMC2650600_38	"Several studies have highlighted the usefulness of 8-isoprostane in the evaluation of oxidative stress in COPD and during COPD exacerbations. This agent is known to exert biological activity such as evoking the contraction of human bronchial smooth muscle in vitro (Paredi et al 2002), and being able to elicit airway hyperresponsiveness (Held and Uhlig 2000) and evoke airway obstruction and plasma exudation (Okazawa et al 1997), evidence that it may be involved in the pathophysiology and progression of COPD. Many cross-sectional studies have shown that 8-isoprostane levels correlate with lung function parameters, but these findings have not been confirmed in longitudinal investigations. As far as we are aware there are no studies to explain how elevated 8-isoprostane levels are associated with COPD phenotypes, respond to treatment in COPD, or whether 8-isoprostane can be used in the follow-up of these patients.

There is more than one phenotype in COPD and asthma and these phenotype subtypes have not been separately evaluated with respect to the profiles of the oxidative stress burden are influenced in the different phenotypes. Currently, there is plenty of research being conducted to develop noninvasive tools for disease detection and follow-up, eg, easy-to-use devices and sensitive and specific technologies. Only practical and readily reproducible, completely noninvasive techniques offer these possibilities. The biomarkers themselves must possess certain characteristics if they are to be of any use. In addition to sensitivity and specificity, a biomarker needs to be stable, with minimal diurnal or day-to-day variability, and it should be easy to access and analyse, and still be cost-effective. Furthermore, the biomarkers should be useful for early diagnostics, differential diagnosis, response to therapy, and for the evaluation of disease progression. It is unlikely that any single biomarker can ever possess all these characteristics. Instead, panels or various combinations of biomarkers are needed. These panels could consist of different components if they are used for either the differential diagnosis or for the assessment of disease severity and its progression.

PMC2650600_40	"Since it seems likely that asthma and COPD are associated with an elevated oxidant burden, these diseases might be treated with exogenous antioxidants or related strategies. It is likely that vitamins taken orally do not reach the critically damaged areas of the lung, which has its own highly specific antioxidant systems. Several attempts have been made to improve GSH homeostasis by treatment with inhaled and oral GSH, since the level of GSH is much higher in the epithelial lining fluid than in any other organ or circulating blood, and decreased by oxidative stress. However, GSH is poorly absorbed through membranes and inhaled GSH itself has been shown to cause bronchoconstriction (Rahman and MacNee 1999). N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) may improve GSH balance but this compound is known to also possess GSH-independent pro-oxidant effects at the cellular level. NAC has been tested and administered by inhalation, orally and intravenously (Rahman and MacNee 1999). Oral NAC has been shown to decrease the risk for COPD re-hospitalisations (Gerrits et al 2003) and to decrease H2O2 levels in the exhaled air in COPD (Kasielski and Nowak 2001), but the results of the multicenter BRONCUS-trial revealed no major effects on lung function values or COPD exacerbations (Dekhuijzen 2004; Decramer et al 2005). A recent systematic review on NAC indicated that the use of NAC could significantly reduce the odds of exacerbation in patients with COPD (Sutherland et al 2006) and therefore could possibly have effects on disease progression. Whether the new antioxidant mimetics that are under development will have benefits in asthma or COPD will be an interesting area of future investigation.

Noninvasive specimens that reflect oxidative stress in the airways include exhaled air, EBC, and induced sputum. Induced sputum is a widely used technique and there are many advantages in using induced sputum both in asthma and COPD. One practical problem with induced sputum, however, is the fact that it is not totally noninvasive and sample processing requires expertise. Nonetheless, induced sputum is promising especially for the analysis of markers with different roles in the pathogenesis of asthma and COPD. One example is the differentiation of the subphenotypes (either airway or emphysema predominance) of COPD by combining the existent knowledge of oxidant markers in the sputum specimens and expanding the methodology to new technologies including proteomics (sputome).

FeNO has been the most widely used of the various markers and has been shown to have clinical significance in asthma, its differential diagnosis and monitoring (Table 1). Further emphasis should be directed in the development of small, easy-to-handle, portable devices for the investigation of the exhaled gas profiles (such as VOCs) and their role especially in COPD. Real time analysis of volatile organic molecules by infrared laser spectroscopy enables online measurement of oxidative markers (Murtz et al 1999) and these techniques offer the potential for real time monitoring of EBC also in asthma and COPD. Metabolomic analysis (quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification) (Nicholson et al 1999) can provide new biochemical profiles for the assessment of low molecular weight metabolites in EBC. These methods include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and allow simultaneous detection of hundreds of low molecular weight species within a single fluid sample. These NMR fingerprints may further improve the characterization of the specific features in asthma and COPD and their differentiation (Carraro et al 2007). Lipidomics has been evaluated in vitro and in the developing lung (Postle et al 2006; Bernhard et al 2007), but its value in asthma and COPD remains to be confirmed in the future.

It is clearly challenging to extrapolate these results from a specific cell type (for example bronchial epithelial cells obtained by bronchial brushing) or from total lung homogenate to a noninvasive specimen such as exhaled air or sputum. It is likely that proteomics offers multiple advantages compared to the gene expression studies since proteins and not genes ultimately determine cellular function (Raj et al 2007). Proteomic studies have also revealed a total of nearly 200 human proteins from the induced sputum specimens (sputome) (Nicholas et al 2006; Casado et al 2007) and these profiles may differ in various airway diseases and phenotypes (Casado et al 2007). Recent studies have also discovered panels/clusters of oxidant/antioxidant enzymes that may be utilized for the assessment of disease severity. Overproduction of ROS can also cause oxidative modifications of several important antioxidant/defense enzymes, which may be associated with alterations in enzyme conformation and thus they can function as markers of the degree of oxidative stress present in the airways. These changes that currently can be analyzed by 2DE electrophoresis and MS but in the future new potent nongel-based proteomic methods may represent the next generation of more specific biomarkers both for asthma and COPD. In view of the overlapping patterns of the profiles of various oxidant biomarkers in asthma and COPD, the utilization of very sophisticated techniques in their assessment is important. Since cigarette smoking is inevitably related to COPD and since smoking only partly overlaps with the pathophysiology of asthma, new tools might offer an easier and cost-effective way for early diagnosis and differentiation of asthma and COPD. The future directions in the search for potential markers of oxidant burden are summarized in Table 2 and Figure 2.

PMC2650600_5	"ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are produced endogenously by several cell types including activated inflammatory and structural cells, the most potent generators of these species being eosinophils and neutrophils, ie, cells that are abundant both in asthma and COPD (Kinnula 2005b). The burden of ROS/RNS is further increased by exogenous factors, mostly by environmental agents and cigarette smoke. One puff of cigarette smoke contains billions of free radicals (Church and Pryor 1985). These ROS, present both in asthma and smoking-related airway diseases, have multiple effects including activation of proteases, mucus secretion, airway smooth muscle contraction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and transcription of many inflammatory genes (Kawikova et al 1996; Rahman and MacNee 1998; Paredi et al 2002; Wood et al 2003).

PMC2650600_6	"Oxidants present in cigarette smoke stimulate alveolar macrophages to further produce ROS, such as superoxide radical (O2), hydroxyl radical (OH), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), leading to release of a number of mediators, some of which attract neutrophils and other inflammatory cells into the lungs of COPD patients (GOLD 2002). Activated inflammatory cells generate more ROS via the NADPH oxidase system. Similarly, increased levels of xanthine oxidase, found in cell free bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and plasma from COPD patients, can elevate O2 and lipid peroxide levels (GOLD 2002). Thus, oxidants may be triggering factors for the inflammation seen in COPD. Asthma on the other hand, may be triggered by viral infections, air pollutants such as ozone and cigarette smoke, and other cellular mediators (Dworski 2000). These agents cause influx and activation of inflammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells) which subsequently evoke the generation of inflammatory mediators. All of these converge to produce ROS which in turn leads to an increased inflammatory response, producing asthma-like symptoms. Oxidative stress is associated with activation of cytokines/growth factors but in these same conditions activated inflammatory cells produce large amounts of ROS into the airways. Thereby it can be postulated that symptoms are not only linked to the airway inflammation but also to the oxidant burden in the airways both in asthma and COPD. ROS have been shown to be associated with the pathogenesis of asthma by evoking bronchial hyperreactivity as well as directly stimulating histamine release from mast cells and mucus secretion from airway epithelial cells (Dworski 2000). Thus, while oxidative stress due to smoking is a direct causative factor for COPD leading to a further elevation of oxidative stress, it is usually a secondary effect in asthma subsequent to a prior antigenic/allergic challenge of immune cells in the lungs.

PMC2650600_7	"Once oxidative stress reaches a critical level, it is difficult to demarcate between the two diseases asthma and COPD. However, site of affliction, the cells involved and the pattern of response by the lungs can help in differentiating these two diseases. In COPD, the major site of attack is the alveolar space. Inflammatory cells themselves become compartmentalized, for example, neutrophils are mainly located in the lumen of the airways and macrophages accumulate in the interstitium in COPD. COPD has been strongly associated with an accumulation of inflammatory mucous exudates in the lumen of the small airways (Saetta et al 2001). In COPD, oxidant stress occurs in small airways, lung parenchyma, and the alveolar regions. In asthma, the larger airways are the major site of action, with the characteristic signs being reversible airflow obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness/hyperreactivity, and chronic inflammation attributable to an influx of eosinophils and activation of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells. Airway smooth muscle contraction, increased airway reactivity and secretions, increased vascular permeability and increased generation of chemoattractants are the major features of an asthmatic response (Hamid et al 1997). Hence, compartmentation of different inflammatory cells in the lungs may help clarify the type of oxidative stress response in asthma and COPD.

PMC2650600_8	"Many oxidants (such as O2 and OH) are unstable and have very short half lives, and are therefore difficult to measure. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is formed from superoxide (mainly by inflammatory cells including both eosinophils and neutrophils) and is directly involved in many reactions. NADPH oxidase is one of the key superoxide generating enzymes that is expressed both in phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells (Jones et al 2000). NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and dual oxidases (DUOXs) may function as potent ROS generators in inflammatory conditions of human airways, but little is known about their role in asthma or COPD. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is abundantly present in neutrophils and catalyses the reaction of H2O2 with chloride forming hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) catalyses the reaction of H2O2 with bromide within eosinophils forming hypobromous acid (HOBr), which is released during the respiratory burst (Wu et al 2000; van Dalen and Kettle 2001; Aldridge et al 2002). Endogenous NO is derived from L-arginine by at least three different isoforms of NOS (Nathan and Xie 1994). Two of these are expressed constitutively (NOS1, NOS3) while the inducible form of NOS (iNOS, NOS2) can be activated by inflammatory cytokines. Inducible NOS generates the majority of the NO encountered in inflammatory states since the enzyme is induced by cytokines and is expressed in inflammatory cells (like neutrophils) as well as in nonphagocytic cells (like alveolar/bronchial epithelial and endothelial cells) (Barnes and Belvisi 1993). Once ROS are generated, they rapidly attack membrane lipids leading to the generation of lipid peroxidation products such as isoprostanoids, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). These markers have been widely used in the assessment of oxidative stress in the lung (Kharitonov and Barnes 2001b; Paredi et al 2002), but a major limitation with most of these end products is their poor specificity and reproducibility in different diseases that are related to oxidative stress. Each of these markers will be discussed below in the context of their use in asthma and COPD diagnosis and differentiation.

PMC2650603_0	"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disorder of the lung that is characterized by irreversible or partially reversible airflow limitation (Rabe et al 2007). It is highly prevalent affecting 600 million people worldwide and accounting for nearly 4 million deaths annually (Murray and Lopez 1997b). Over the next 20 years, the burden of COPD is expected to increase, making it the third leading cause of mortality worldwide (currently fourth) (Murray and Lopez 1997a). COPD is a relentless and progressive disease, caused by a complex interaction between genes and environment. Although cigarette smoking is the single most important risk factor, smokers constitute only ~50% of the worldwide cases of COPD; the rest occur in life-time never smokers (Mannino and Buist 2007). Furthermore, once COPD develops, smoking cessation does not abrogate the increased risk of morbidity and mortality (though the risk is smaller than when they were actively smoking) (Anthonisen et al 2005; Pelkonen et al 2000; Sin et al 2005b) and smoking cessation does not halt the underlying inflammatory process in the lungs of COPD patients (Willemse et al 2005). Other known risk factors for COPD include airway hyperresponsiveness, genetic abnormalities such as alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, air pollution, biomass smoke exposure, occupational dusts and chemicals, respiratory infections especially during childhood, and poor nutrition (Chapman et al 2006). Unfortunately, there is a dearth of therapies that can effectively modify disease activity or progression. The current treatment is largely aimed at relieving patient symptoms and reducing long-term complications (Sin et al 2003) and is modified by disease severity (Rabe et al 2007). The management algorithms for moderate to severe COPD have been reviewed expertly elsewhere (Sin et al 2003; Wilt et al 2007). In this paper, we will review the management goals and strategies for patients with mild COPD.

PMC2650603_1	"COPD is diagnosed clinically based on history and physical examination, complemented by spirometric data demonstrating irreversible or poorly reversible airflow obstruction in the absence of an alternate diagnosis such as congestive heart failure, neuromuscular disease or asthma (Man et al 2003). Most but not all patients with COPD are either current or ex-smokers with at least 10 pack-year smoking history (pack-years is calculated by multiplying the number of cigarettes smoked per day by the years smoked divided by 20). The most common presenting symptom is dyspnea with exertion or chronic cough with or without sputum production. Other (but more infrequent) symptoms include chest pain, orthopnea and wheezing. However, there is also a group of patients with abnormal spirometry but are otherwise asymptomatic. The physical examination is completely unremarkable in most patients with mild COPD. In some cases, however, patients may demonstrate a positive cough test (which is defined as recurrent coughing after patients take a deep breath to maximal lung capacity and coughs more than once), and have a forced expiratory time at the bedside of 9 seconds or greater (Straus et al 2000). On spirometry, patients with COPD demonstrate a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of less than 0.70 following receipt of a bronchodilator (eg, albuterol 200400 g) (ODonnell et al 2007; Rabe et al 2007). Once the diagnosis of COPD is made, severity is assessed using the post-bronchodilator FEV1 value. An example of the severity classification scheme is shown in Figure 1 (ODonnell et al 2007). Mild COPD is defined by a post-bronchodilator FEV1 that is 80% of predicted or greater in the presence of an FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% and characteristic symptoms such as exertional dyspnea in most cases (Celli and MacNee 2004; Rabe et al 2007). However, some who meet the spirometric criteria of mild COPD may be asymptomatic. In one study of patients who were seen at a primary care office, over a third of ex- and current smokers who were diagnosed with mild COPD based on screening spirometry were asymptomatic at the time of testing, while 2/3 of never smokers diagnosed with mild COPD were asymptomatic (Bednarek et al 2008). Thus, the prevalence of COPD based on physician or self-diagnosis likely under-estimates the prevalence of COPD based on spirometry (Buist et al 2007). A more liberal use of spirometry in primary care may increase the detection and diagnosis of COPD in the community.

Upon ligand binding, the -component of the G-protein dissociates and activates adenylate cyclase (Johnson 1998), which in turn stimulates the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then phosphorylates a number of intracellular regulatory proteins (Johnson 1998). Stimulation of the 2- adrenoreceptors can also inhibit histamine and cysteinyl-leukotriene release from mast cells, prevent plasma exudation from postcapillary venules, and modulate sensory neural outputs in the airways (Johnson 1998). Thus, in addition their bronchodilatory properties, 2-agonists may have anti-inflammatory effects.

Ipratropium bromide is the prototypical short acting anticholinergic agent, which has a half-life of less than 6 hours (Rabe et al 2007). Tiotropium is a longer acting anticholinergic agent that is approximately 10-fold more potent than ipratropium bromide. This is because tiotropium dissociates very slowly from lung muscarinic receptors and in airway smooth muscles demonstrates partial selectivity for the M3-receptors.

In the 1990s, several large-scale randomized controlled trials were conducted to clearly define the benefits and the hazards of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD. All of these studies were powered to determine whether or not inhaled corticosteroids modified the rate of decline in FEV1. However, several studies also captured the effects of these drugs on patient symptoms. In one of the largest study of its kind, the Lung Health Study (LHS)-2 evaluated the effects of inhaled triamcinolone on symptoms in patients with mild to moderate COPD (mean FEV1, 68% of predicted) (Lung Health Study Group, 2000). On average, the subjects were followed for 40 months. Triamcinolone had no significant effect on cough and sputum production (p = 0.26) but a significant impact in reducing dyspnea (p = 0.02). Sixty-eight percent of patients in the triamcinolone arm did not complain of dyspnea by the end of the study, while 62% did not have dyspnea in the placebo arm (a difference of 6.7%). Importantly, compared with placebo, there was a 29% relative reduction in the number of patients who complained of difficulty breathing (p = 0.05), and a 35% relative reduction in the number of patients with wheezing in the group that took triamcinolone (Lung Health Study Group, 2000). In the Copenhagen City Heart Study (mean FEV1, 87% of predicted), similar to LHS-2, inhaled budesonide did not have a significant impact on cough and sputum production (Vestbo et al 1999). Collectively, these data suggest that inhaled corticosteroids probably do not have any significant effect on cough and sputum production; they appear to have a modest effect in reducing dyspnea. However, in view of the long-term safety concerns associated with inhaled corticosteroids including bone demineralization and skin bruising, they cannot be routinely recommended in patients with mild COPD. Inhaled corticosteroids may be considered for patients with dyspnea refractory to smoking cessation and bronchodilators.

Inhaled budesonide also reduced the number of pulmonary nodules detected on computed tomographic (CT) scans (Lam et al 2004). In the Inhaled Steroid Effects Evaluation in COPD (ISEEC) study, which was a pooled analysis of 7 large trials of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD, there was a trend towards lower cancer mortality in the group that received corticosteoroids compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 1.03) (Sin et al 2005a). Long-term large-scale trials are needed to confirm these early observations and determine the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on lung cancer in COPD patients.

Macie and colleagues, using another large administrative database from Manitoba, showed that COPD patients who used inhaled corticosteroids were nearly 40% less likely to suffer a cardiac mortality than those who did not (Macie et al 2006). In EUROSCOP (European Respiratory Societys study on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), 1,277 patients with mild to moderate COPD (mean FEV1, 77% of predicted) were assigned to inhaled budesonide or placebo for 3 years. A post hoc analysis of the safety data demonstrated that patients assigned to inhaled budesonide had 42% fewer ischemic cardiac events (defined as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, or myocardial infarction) compared to those assigned to placebo (p = 0.048) (Lofdahl et al 2007).

The cornerstone of management is smoking cessation, which not only improves patient symptoms but is the only proven way of modifying its natural history and reducing mortality. Vaccinations for influenza and pneumococcus may reduce morbidity and mortality from community-acquired pneumonia. In patients who have intermittent symptoms, short-acting bronchodilators may be used on an as as-needed basis, while for patients with more persistent symptoms, these drugs may be given regularly (eg, 4 times a day). In patients whose symptoms are refractory to short-acting bronchodilators, long-acting bronchodilators may be provided. LABAs and tiotropium appear to have similar effectiveness for patients with mild disease. Pulmonary rehabilitation regimens may also improve exercise tolerance and quality of life. In a small minority of patients who remain symptomatic despite long-acting bronchodilators, a combination of inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs may be considered. Although inhaled corticosteroids by themselves reduce dyspnea and improve lung function, they probably should not be the sole therapy for patients with mild disease in view of their potential long-term side effects. Inhaled corticosteroids do not appear to modify the long-term decline in FEV1; however, there are emerging data suggesting their potential usefulness in reducing the risk of lung cancer and CVD, which are the leading causes of mortality and hospitalization in mild COPD. However, before this notion can be fully accepted, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to validate these early findings.

PMC2650603_4	"Symptomatic treatment starts with smoking cessation for smokers with mild COPD. In a dose dependent manner, smoking induces cough and dyspnea and smoking cessation attenuates these symptoms (Stein et al 2005). Although the prevalence of smoking has declined over the past two decades in the US and other industrialized nations, 20% of adults in the western world continue to smoke. In the developing world, smoking rates are increasing with nearly 40% of adults smoking on a daily basis in certain jurisdictions (Ezzati and Lopez 2003). Although clinicians should encourage patients to stop smoking and provide practical advices in their clinic, these measures are generally ineffective, leading to smoking cessation in only about 5% of smokers (Bailey 1985). This intervention, however, is more effective when offered at the time the diagnosis of COPD is made (Stratelis et al 2006). Another way to increase cessation rate is to convey the concept of lung age to the patients. Lung age is defined as the age of the average person who has the same FEV1 as that of the patient and can be calculated using the formula: lung age (for men) = 2.87  height (in inches) 31.25  observed FEV1 (liters)  39.375 and lung age (for women) = age = 3.56  height (in inches)  40  observed FEV1 (liters)  77.28 (Morris and Temple 1985). In the largest randomized trial of its kind, Parkes et al showed that smokers who received information regarding their lung age were twice as more likely to quit than smokers who received their raw FEV1 data (Parkes et al 2008). At 12 months of follow-up, the cessation rate was 14% in the lung age group versus 6% in the control group.

Anti-depressants and in particular bupropion significantly enhance cessation rates. Similar to NRTs, bupropion and nortryptylline double the quitting rates compared with advice alone (Hughes et al 2007). Bupropion should be prescribed at least 1 week before the cessation date, so that adequate blood levels can be achieved and continued for 2 to 3 months following cessation. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not anti-depressants provide incremental benefits on cessation beyond that achieved by NRT alone. Serious side effects from anti-depressants are relatively uncommon. The risk of seizures is about 0.1% with the use of bupropion (Hughes et al 2007). Thus, bupropion should be avoided in patients with a seizure disorder (Schroeder 2005). Although there are ongoing concerns regarding the possible increased risk of suicides among those who take bupropion, there is insufficient body of evidence to support this notion.

Varenicline is a partial 42 nicotinic receptor agonist. It is approximately three times more effective in effecting smoking cessation than is placebo (Cahill et al 2007). It should be started at 0.5 mg daily while the patient is still smoking and then escalated to 1 mg per day by the second week. The patient should quit smoking completely by week 2 and the drug should be continued for another 12 weeks. The most common side effect of this drug is nausea, which can be mitigated by taking the drug following meals. Varenicline appears to be more effective than bupropion (odds ratio for smoking cessation, 1.66) (Cahill et al 2007). However, it should be used with extreme caution (if at all) in patients with a past history of severe depression or a psychosis as it has been rarely associated with major psychiatric adverse effects (Pumariega et al 2008).

For those with persistent symptoms, short-acting bronchodilators may be used regularly (eg, 4 times a day) or, alternatively, long-acting bronchodilators may be used instead. All bronchodilators work by increasing expiratory flow, reducing dynamic hyperinflation and improving exercise capacity and quality of life of patients (Hanania and Donohue 2007). However, the improvement in symptoms and exercise capacity is not readily predictable from the spirometric response to bronchodilators.

COPD is currently the 4th major cause of death worldwide. The prevalence is estimated to be about 1% worldwide, but is about 2 times higher in Western societies, and often underestimated due to un- or misdiagnosis (Pauwels and Rabe 2004; Menezes et al 2005; Lindberg et al 2006). The burden of COPD for the patient is high as patients experience a poorer quality of life, suffer from comorbidites (3.7 comorbidities per patient), and direct healthcare costs range from 0.28 billion euros in the Netherlands (in 2000) to 20.9 billion dollars in the USA (in 2004) (Hynninen et al 2005; Hoogendoorn et al 2006; Jones 2006; Sin et al 2006).

More than 90% of patients with COPD are smokers (Snider 1989), but at least 10%20% of the smokers develop COPD pointing at an additional risk factor, eg, gene susceptibility. Among the genetic susceptibility factors are polymorphisms in genes coding for (anti-) proteases like alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) (accounting for at least 5% of COPD cases) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 33 (ADAM33), genes coding for antioxidant enzymes like glutamate cysteine ligase, epoxide hydrolase, glutathione-S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) 3, or genes coding for cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF1) (Harrison et al 1997; Keatings et al 2000; Sandford et al 2001; Kucukaycan et al 2002; Celedon et al 2004; Gosman, Boezen et al 2006; Young et al 2006).

In addition to the inflammatory effects, recent studies provided more evidence that cytokines and chemokines are also involved in tissue remodeling apart from growth factors, pointing to cytokine-driven effects of inflammatory cells on epithelial wound repair (De Boer et al 2007) (Figure 1).
"	
PMC2695202_11	"CCL2 is produced by a variety of cells including macrophages, endothelial and epithelial cells. It binds to CCR2, a receptor that is highly expressed on circulating blood DCs and monocytes, and thus primarily controls their recruitment from the blood vessels to the tissue. CCL2 is also involved in tissue remodelling. In vitro, CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 were demonstrated to be directly involved in endothelial and lung epithelial cell proliferation, migration and wound closure (De Boer et al 2007). In addition, CCL2 was found to stimulate collagen synthesis in rat lung fibroblasts via a TGF1-dependent pathway, hence potentially contributing to a fibrogenetic remodelling as seen in COPD. In turn, TGF1 was reported to induce CCL2 protein levels via downstream intracellular mechanisms including ROS, and MAPK p38 and p42/44 in mesangial cells (Cheng et al 2005). Results from studies in mice and cell lines suggest that oxidative stress activates MAPK p42/44 and p38 which stimulates the expression of TNF, IL-1, CCL2 and CXCL10 (Nishi et al 2005; Guest et al 2006; Huang et al 2006; Loke et al 2006). Oxidative stress led to an influx of macrophages and increased expression of proteins like NADPH oxidase, thioredoxin- 1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, via a CCR2- mediated mechanism (Hayasaki et al 2006). These effects were inhibitable by antioxidants including N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, quercetin or overexpression of SOD1, deletion of CCR2, or by inhibition of MAPK p42/44 or p38 (Nishi et al 2005; Guest et al 2006; Hayasaki et al 2006; Huang et al 2006; Loke et al 2006). Hence the CCL2-CCR2-TGF axis may potentially contribute to tissue remodeling and inflammation as seen in COPD.

PMC2695202_12	"CXCL1 (GRO) and CXCL8 are produced by both structural and inflammatory cells including macrophages. Both bind to their receptor CXCR2 whereas CXCL8 binds also to CXCR1. Both receptors are expressed on neutrophils while CXCR2 is also expressed on other inflammatory cells including a subset of CD8+ T cells, mast cells and macrophages. CXCL1 and CXCL8 are chemotactic and activate inflammatory cells while CXCL8 also induces neutrophils to degranulate and causes an oxidative burst. Recent studies demonstrated that cigarette smoke-conditioned medium induces human monocytes or macrophages in vitro to release CXCL8 (Karimi et al 2006; Yang et al 2006). As inhibitors of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, NF-B and IKK-2 impaired the CXCL8 expression this points to a TLR4 and NF-B dependent mechanism. In addition, CXCL8 release was significantly inhibited by the anti-oxidant glutathione pointing to a regulatory effect of the chemokine expression by the redox status of the cells (Yang et al 2006). In contrast to monocytes, cigarette smoke conditioned medium did not affect CXCL8 or IL-6 expression nor NF-B activation in human lung epithelial cells in vitro (Moodie et al 2004). This suggests that oxidants exert differential effects on NF-B signalling and chemokine expression depending on the cell type, and that inflammatory cells produce CXCL8 upon oxidant exposure. The study showed that also epithelial cells express CXCR2 suggesting a role for CXCL8/CXCR2 in wound repair (De Boer 2002). In vivo, impaired CXCR2 expression in mice resulted in delayed skin wound repair as compared to wild type mice, which cannot be restored by exogenous CXCL8 (Devalaraja et al 2000; Milatovic et al 2003). In contrast, topical application of CXCL1 or CXCL8 stimulated human skin wound repair in chimeric mice (Rennekampff et al 1997, 2000), and stimulated human colon, skin and lung epithelial proliferation and/or migration in vitro (De Boer et al 2007). Inhibition of CXCL8 or CXCL1 signaling or expression as a treatment target in COPD may hence inhibit inflammatory cell activation and tissue degradation, but may potentially delay wound repair in COPD.

The release of proinflammatory mediators, such as IL-1 and soluble ICAM-1, was increased by cigarette smoke exposure in bronchial epithelial cells cultured from biopsy materials obtained from patients with COPD compared to smokers (Rusznak et al 2000). Moreover, Scott and coworkers (2000) demonstrated a clear dose-dependent relationship between smoke intake and sICAM-1 concentrations and sICAM-1 concentrations substantially reduced in those who stopped smoking for a year but remained elevated in continuing smokers.

With regard to COPD several studies suggest the involvement of these families in either pulmonary inflammation like for VEGF and TGF1 (De Boer et al 1998; Takizawa et al 2001; Postma and Timens 2006), vascular or tissue remodeling like for EGF-like growth factors, FGFs and VEGFs (Kranenburg et al 2002, 2005; De Boer et al 2006; Postma and Timens 2006), or oxidative stress as with TGF1 or FGF-7 (Rahman et al 2000; Rahman et al 2002; Ray et al 2003) (Table 1).

In addition, in murine models tobacco smoke exposure leads to decreased expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors as well as emphysematous lesions, as has also been observed in smokers with emphysema. Furthermore, blockade of VEGF receptors was shown to induce oxidative stress and alveolar cell apoptosis that was inhibited by exogenous administration of the SOD mimetic M40419 (Tuder et al 2003). These data link oxidative stress with development of emphysema and abrogated VEGF signaling rather than alveolar damage induced by inflammation alone. Tuder and coworkers proposed a disturbed balance between oxidative stress, proteinases, antiproteinases and apoptosis, and lung inflammation as a non-specific reaction secondary to alveolar tissue damage (Tuder et al 2006). However, these data may not be applied to COPD as a whole as VEGF and VEGFR expression was observed to be enhanced in relation to vascular remodeling in non-emphysematous patients making these patients less eligible for VEGF therapy (Kranenburg et al 2005; De Boer et al 2007).

PMC2695202_16	"TGF1 has been associated with COPD either as a result of oxidative stress or an imbalance in proteinases and antiproteinases, but may also be related to an aberrant repair process and hence progression of COPD (Postma and Timens 2006; Rahman and Adcock 2006). TGF1 expression was demonstrated to be enhanced in patients with COPD (De Boer et al 1998) but decreased in patients with emphysema (Zandvoort et al 2006). The expression of intracellular inhibitory signaling proteins of TGF1, Smad6 and Smad7, was observed to be decreased both in bronchial and alveolar tissue from patients with COPD, whereas in expression of stimulatory Smad molecules including Smad3 was unaltered (Springer et al 2004; Zandvoort et al 2006). Smad7 is involved in the regulation of expression of inflammatory proteins. In vivo wound healing study with mice demonstrated that overexpression of Smad7 inhibits TGF1, CCL2, VEGF, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 protein and mRNA expression (Saika et al 2005). Reducing overexpression of Smad7 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using antisense Smad7 oligonucleotides caused a decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines IFN and TNF upon treatment of intestinal tissue explants and cells with TGF1 (Monteleone et al 2001). With regard to COPD, it is not known whether Smad7 downregulation is intrinsic or due to inflammation, oxidative stress, or other factors, and what the consequences are of differential expression of TGF1 in patients with COPD or emphysema alone. An alternative hypothesis is that tobacco smoke exposure causes excessive growth factor production resulting in tissue remodeling, independent of inflammation. Recent data from a murine study (Churg et al 2006) provided support for this idea. Their study demonstrated that short-term smoke exposure for 2 hours stimulated early growth factor expression including TGF1 and type 1 procollagen synthesis before the onset of inflammation. Upon chronic smoke exposure for up to 6 months profibrotic growth factor expression continued as well as tissue remodeling characterized by enhanced collagen deposition, while other studies showed the development of airway inflammation and emphysema in rodents in this period. Taken together, the balance between TGF1 and Smad7 expression in pulmonary cells of patients with COPD seems to be delicate and may affect tissue remodeling and inflammation differently depending on the COPD phenotype. Targeting TGF1 as a therapy in COPD requires more studies on the precise role of these factors in the pathogenesis of COPD.

Though some recent studies using higher doses or longer duration of treatment showed reduced airway inflammation, steroid treatment of patients with COPD is rather ineffective in reducing the decline in lung function (Barnes and Stockley 2005; Gan et al 2005). Adverse effects of steroids include increased risk of hip fractures and osteoporosis, skin bruising and candidiasis (Gartlehner et al 2006), and the airway remodeling is not positively affected by the current treatment. Anti-oxidant therapy by mucolytics such as N-acetylcysteine is also being used as a treatment reducing acute exacerbation frequency, but generally fails to reduce airway inflammation or decline in lung function (Poole and Black 2006; Sadowska et al 2007).

PMC2695202_19	"Smoking and exacerbations of COPD result in decreased antioxidant capacity in plasma in association with depleted protein sulphydryls in the plasma (Rahman et al 1996, 1997; Corradi et al 2003). The decrease in antioxidant capacity in smokers occurs transiently during smoking and resolves rapidly after smoking cessation. In exacerbations of COPD, however, antioxidant capacity remains low for several days after the onset of the exacerbation, tending to return towards normal values at the time of recovery from the exacerbation (Rahman et al 1997). The depletion of antioxidant capacity could in part be explained by the increased release of ROS from peripheral blood neutrophils, as shown by a significant negative correlation between neutrophil superoxide anion release and plasma antioxidant capacity (Rahman et al 1996). Thus there is clear evidence that oxidants in cigarette smoke markedly decreases plasma antioxidants, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD. Furthermore, it is possible that inter-individual differences in antioxidant capacity may contribute to the differences in susceptibility to cigarette-smoke induced COPD. Thus, it is imperative to propose the rationale for antioxidant therapy ameliorating the increased oxidative stress and consequently the inflammatory response in COPD.

Moreover, decreased vitamin E and vitamin C levels were reported in leukocytes and BAL fluids from smokers. Ascorbate appears to be a particularly important antioxidant in the plasma. Cigarette smoke-induced lipid peroxidation of plasma in vitro is decreased by ascorbate (Cross et al 1994). Reduced levels of vitamin E and a marginal increase in vitamin C in the BAL fluid of smokers, compared to nonsmokers have been shown (Rahman and MacNee 1996a).

In the general population there is a positive association between dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins and lung function. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated negative associations of dietary antioxidant intake with pulmonary function and with obstructive airway disease (Grievink et al 1998). Britton and co-workers (Britton et al 1995) showed a positive association between dietary intake of the antioxidant vitamin E and lung function in a population of 2,633 subjects, supporting the hypothesis that this antioxidant may have a role in protecting against the development of COPD. Another study has suggested that antioxidant levels in the diet could be a possible explanation for differences in COPD mortality in different populations (Sargeant et al 2000). Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids may also protect cigarette smokers against the development of COPD (Shahar et al 1999). These studies support the concept that dietary antioxidant supplementation including polyphenols may be a possible therapy to prevent or inhibit the oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, which are key features in the development of COPD.

Similarly, it has been shown that treatment with NAC 600 mg once daily for 12 months also reduced the concentration of H2O2 in EBC compared to placebo in stable COPD patients (Kasielski and Nowak 2001). A more recent clinical trial also proves that oral administration of NAC 600 mg b.i.d. for 2 months rapidly reduces the oxidant burden in airways of stable COPD patients (De Benedetto et al 2005).

Orally dosed NAC has been shown to increase phagocytic activity of BAL macrophages from healthy smokers, but similar results were not seen in COPD patients, possibly due to active concentrations of NAC not reaching the lung, as in vitro analysis of cells support an induction of phagocytosis by NAC. It has also been reported recently that orally dosed NAC increased the quadriceps endurance time of severe COPD patients (Koechlin et al 2004), thus suggesting that NAC administration may have beneficial effects on the systemic oxidative stress associated with COPD. However, a multi-centre study using NAC delivered by metered dose inhalers in patients with chronic cough failed to show a positive effect on well being, sensation of dyspnoea, cough or lung function (Dueholm et al 1992).

A phase III multicentre Bronchitis Randomized on NAC Cost-Utility Study (BRONCUS) has recently been completed, with the aim of addressing this question and determining whether the effectiveness of NAC as an antioxidant results in an alteration in the rate of decline in FEV1, exacerbation rate and quality of life in patients with moderate to severe COPD and hence support NAC administration as a maintenance therapy for COPD (Gerrits et al 2003; Dekhuijzen 2004).

The advantage of NAL over NAC is that it has a neutral pH in solution, whereas NAC is acidic. NAL can be aerosolized into the lung without causing significant side effects (Gillissen et al 1997). Gillissen and co-workers compared the effect of NAL and NAC and found that both drugs enhance intracellular glutathione in alveolar epithelial cells and inhibited hydrogen peroxide and O2  released from human blood-derived polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) from smokers with COPD (Gillissen et al 1997). NAL also inhibited ROS generation induced by serum-opsonised zymosan by human neutrophils. This inhibitory response was comparable to the effects of NAC (Gillissen et al 1997). Antonicelli and colleagues have shown that NAL inhibited oxidant-mediated CXCL8 release in alveolar epithelial A549 cells suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of NAL (Antonicelli et al 2002). Therefore, NAL may represent an interesting alternative approach to augment the antioxidant screen and thereby inhibiting inflammatory responses in the lungs and has the advantage over other antioxidant agents in that it may be administered by inhalation. The clinical trials using NAL in the treatment of COPD are in progress.

Thus, it was speculated that a drug might be synthesized that possessed greater bioavailability than NAC, and could be used as a more effective treatment for chronic bronchitis. N-isobutyrylcysteine (NIC) is a NAC-like thiol compound that does not undergo effective first-pass hydrolysis and hence has a higher oral bioavailability than NAC (Ekberg-Jansson et al 1999). The oral bioavailability can be as high as 80%, dependent on food intake. However, when evaluated as a therapy for exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, NIC performed no better than placebo drugs, and not as well as NAC (Gillissen et al 1997). Furthermore, a study of NIC also failed to reduce exacerbation rates in patients with COPD (Ekberg-Jansson et al 1999).

PMC2695202_3	"COPD is an inflammatory chronic lung disease that shows a largely irreversible lung function decline, and can be classified into 4 classes of severity based on lung function [GOLD Guidelines]. Emphysema, chronic bronchitis with airway obstruction, and small airways disease are the distinct phenotypes of COPD, but most patients show a combination. Emphysema is characterized by a Th1-type inflammation, destruction of the alveolar septa, loss of elastic recoil, airspace enlargement and hence loss of gas diffusion capacity (Wright and Churg 2006). Chronic bronchitis affects the airways by airway inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus hypersecretion. In addition to decreased lung function, these patients experience chronic sputum production, coughing and often dyspnoea. Ciliated airway epithelium lining the airway lumen is impaired in its function due to the hypersecreted mucus, and in activation and damage by tobacco compounds. As a result, the ciliated epithelium may be partly replaced by other epithelial cell types like squamous and goblet cells, further contributing to the airway dysfunction. The inflammatory phenotype in chronic bronchitis is neutrophilic or eosinophilic. In eosinophilic chronic bronchitis the sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid presents more eosinophils whereas in neutrophilic airway inflammation predominates the neutrophilic phenotype. The eosinophilic phenotype exhibits a higher reversible forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) as compared to the neutrophilic phenotype, and is more responsive to corticosteroid treatment (Chanez et al 1997; Pizzichini et al 1998; Brightling et al 2005). Small airways disease mainly affects the bronchioles featuring airway inflammation and metaplasia of Clara cells.

In the Equalife randomized placebo controlled clinical study, erdosteine was dosed orally 300 mg twice a day (b.i.d) for a period of 8 months (Moretti et al 2004). Patients receiving erdosteine had significantly fewer exacerbations and spent less days in hospital than the placebo group. Moreover, patients receiving erdosteine showed no reduction in lung function over this period and showed a significant improvement in health related quality of life. It is not clear whether this clinical benefit is due to antioxidant effects of erdosteine. The mucolytic effect of erdosteine is perhaps due to the presence of a sulphydryl group. It may be possible that erdosteine may reduce bacterial colonization through a direct effect on adhesion.

PMC2695202_36	"Studies with IB mutants (Baldwin 1996; Ghosh et al 1998) gave the first evidence that NF-B pathway could be specifically inhibited. Signal-induced phosphorylation and degradation of cytoplasmic IB is required for NF-B pathway activation. However, an IB protein with mutations at serine-32 and 36 is not phosphorylated by IKK (IB kinase) and therefore not degraded by the proteasome. This IB mutant or super-repressor exerts its negative effect by sequestering NF-B in the cytoplasm and thus prevents the induction of specific NF-B target genes.
"	
PMC2695202_37	"Another novel way whereby NF-B activity may be regulated is by the use of inhibitors of proteasome function, which can reduce the degradation of IB and thus prevent NF-B activation (Baldwin 1996; Ghosh et al 1998). A series of peptide aldehydes such as MG101, MG132, and MG115, make up a family of agents that inhibit the protease activity of the proteasome. Lactacystin, another class of proteasome inhibitor, blocks proteolytic activity by acylating a threonine residue in one of the key proteasome subunits. Furthermore, a group of boronic acid peptides, including PS-341, are extremely potent inhibitors of proteasome function (Adams et al 1999), thus inhibiting activation of the NF-B pathway. It is also possible that inhibitors of the ubiquitin ligase that mediates IB ubiquitination may be a useful target in preventing proteasome degradation of IB. Thus, a wide variety of potential inhibitors of proteasome function may have a therapeutic role in anti- NF-B pathway dependent strategies.
"	
PMC2695202_39	"Thus it is evident that there are several possible approaches to inhibition of NF-kB, including gene transfer of IB, inhibitors of IB kinases (IKK), NF-B-inducing kinase and IB ubiquitin ligase, which regulate the activity of NF-B, and inhibit the degradation of IB (Delhase et al 2000). The most promising approach however, may be the inhibition of IKK-2 by small molecule inhibitors (Castro et al 2003) (Table 2), which suppress the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from alveolar macrophages (Jazrawi et al 2003). This in particular might be more effective in COPD, particularly since alveolar macrophages are resistant to the anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids (see HDACs modifiers). It is however, of concern that long-term inhibition of NF-B, with effective inhibitors may result in immune suppression and therefore impair host defenses. This concern is validated from a study that mice lacking NF-B genes succumb to septicemia. However, alternative modulation of pathways of NF-B activation via kinases other than IKK might be a more safer approach in inflammatory disease and would have less potential effect on innate and adaptive immune responses (Nasuhara et al 1999).

PMC2695202_47	"Neutrophil elastase is a serine protease that is synthesized in the neutrophils and secreted following neutrophils activation. One of the major actions of neutrophil elastase is its ability to degrade matrix proteins and appears to be a key enzyme in the development of hereditary due to -antitrypsin deficiency. Although its role in the development of non hereditary emphysema is currently unclear it also has a broad range of actions that are consistent with it having a pro-inflammatory role in COPD pathogenesis (Shapiro et al 2003; Chughtai and ORiordan 2004). Neutrophil elastase can increase MMPs activity by directly activating MMPs such as MMP-9 (Ferry et al 1997) and by inactivating the endogenous MMP inhibitor, TIMP (Okada et al 1988), thus potentially enhancing the role of MMPs in COPD. Neutrophil elastase has also been reported to stimulate mucin secretion and modulate apoptosis of human lung epithelial cells.

Similarly, a small molecule neutrophil elastase inhibitor, ZD0892, reduced cigarette smoke induced emphysema and pulmonary cells recruitment in a guinea pig model (Wright et al 2002).

PMC2695202_5	"Mechanisms that may contribute to the pathogenesis involve disturbed oxidant-antioxidant and proteinase-antiproteinase balances. Lungs are continuously exposed to oxidants, either generated endogenously by metabolic reactions (eg, from mitochondrial electron transport during respiration or during activation of phagocytes) or exogenously, such as air pollutants or cigarette smoke. Tobacco smoke constitutes about 5000 compounds and 1017 free radicals per puff, many of which are able to induce reactive oxygen or nitrogen species that can be inactivated by endogenous molecules like SOD, catalase, cytochrome P450, flavanoids and glutathione. In patients with COPD this balance may be disturbed due to mutations in genes encoding these enzymes or enzymes related to these pathways (Langen et al 2003; Rahman and Adcock 2006). Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been directly linked to oxidation of proteins, DNA, and lipids, which may cause direct lung injury or induce a variety of cellular responses, through the generation of secondary metabolic reactive species (Repine et al 1997). ROS may alter remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and blood vessels, stimulate mucus secretion, inactivate antiproteases, cause apoptosis, and regulate cell proliferation (Rahman and MacNee 1996a, 1996b, 1999). Furthermore, increased levels of ROS have been implicated in initiating inflammatory responses in the lungs through the activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), signal transduction, chromatin remodeling and gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (Rahman and MacNee 1998).

PMC2695202_51	"NF-B being a pro-inflammatory transcription factor, on activation binds to specific recognition sequence motifs in DNA and subsequently interacts with a multitude of co-activator molecules, such as cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB), CREB-binding protein (CBP), p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (pCAF). These co-activators act as molecular switches of transcription and acetylate histones by their intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (Ogryzko et al 1996; Roth et al 2001). Acetylation of core histones allow DNA unwinding and thus access to wide variety of transcription factors (Roth et al 2001). The transcriptional process can be reversibly switched off by deacetylation of acetylated histones, thus rewinding the exposed DNA, consequently leading to gene silencing. The deacetylation of acetylated histones is brought about by histone deacetylases (HDACs), which act as co-repressors, in association with other co-repressor proteins that are concomitantly recruited. Since all inflammatory processes involve acetylation and deacetylation of histones (chromatin remodeling) (Barnes 2006), HDACs therefore are attractive targets for anti-inflammatory therapies.

Furthermore, we have shown that both cigarette smoke/H2O2 and TNF- caused an increase in histone acetylation (HAT activity) leading to CXCL8 expression in monocytes and alveolar epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo in rat lungs (Rahman et al 2002; Marwick et al 2004; Moodie et al 2004).

PMC2695202_53	"Glucocorticoid suppression of inflammatory genes requires recruitment of HDAC2 to the transcription activation complex by the glucocorticoid receptor (Ito et al 2001; Rahman et al 2004). This results in deacetylation of histones and a decrease in inflammatory gene transcription. A reduced level of HDAC2 was associated with increased proinflammatory response and reduced responsiveness to glucocorticoids in alveolar macrophages obtained from smokers (Ito et al 2001; Rahman et al 2002; Marwick et al 2004; Moodie et al 2004; Rahman et al 2004). Culpitt and co-workers have shown that cigarette smoke solution stimulated release of CXCL8 and GM-CSF, which was not inhibited by dexamethasone, in alveolar macrophages obtained from patients with COPD compared to that of smokers (Culpitt et al 2003). They suggested that the lack of efficacy of corticosteroids in COPD might be due to steroid insensitivity of macrophages in the respiratory tract. Thus, the cigarette smoke/oxidant-mediated reduction in HDAC2 levels in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages will not only increase inflammatory gene expression but will also cause a decrease in glucocorticoid function in patients with COPD. HDAC2 activity has also been measured in bronchial biopsies and alveolar macrophages from COPD patients and smoking control, demonstrating a significant decrease in HDAC2 activity, the magnitude of which increased with severity of disease (Ito et al 2005) (Table 1).

PMC2695202_56	"As a major proinflammatory cytokine TNF and its receptors TNFR1 (or: TNFR p55) and TNFR2 (or: TNFR p75) seem to play an important role in many chronic diseases including COPD and asthma. Therefore, several drugs have been developed to reduce TNF levels, of which some have been approved by eg, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of RA, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohns disease, or psoriasis. These approved drugs include etanercept (soluble human TNFR2), infliximab (chimeric human/mouse IgG1 antibody against TNF), and adalumimab (human IgG1 antibody against TNF). Many others are being developed in order to enhance efficacy, reduce side effects due to frequent subcutaneous injection, increase bioavailability or protection to proteolytic degradation by coupling to polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, or reduce immunogenicity by humanization of antibodies or designing small molecules. Some examples are given in Table 2. Recent clinical trial phase II studies demonstrated that patients with moderate to severe asthma may profit from treatment with either of these drugs. Three infusions of infliximab over 6 weeks reduced the number of exacerbations as well as sputum levels of TNF, IL-6, CXCL8 and CXCL10 but not peak expiratory flow (PEF) or inflammatory cell count in sputum of patients with moderate asthma (Erin et al 2006). Other studies demonstrated that twice-weekly treatment with etanercept during 10 to 12 weeks improved the bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR, expressed as PC20), post-bronchodilator FEV1 and the quality of life of patients with refractory, severe asthmatic patients (Howarth et al 2005; Berry et al 2006). Treatment of asthmatics with Marimastat, an inhibitor of TNF and MMP activation, also reduced BHR but failed to significantly reduce sputum inflammatory cell numbers, asthma symptoms, FEV1 or bronchodilator use (Bruce and Thomas 2005). In contrast to asthma, 2 studies showed that treatment of COPD patients with 3 infusions of infliximab over 6 to 24 weeks did not result in any significant improvement of lung function, airway inflammation, or quality of life (Abdelhady et al 2005; van der Vaart et al 2005; Rennard et al 2007). Treatment may have some beneficial effect on physical endurance seen by the 6 minute walking distance test (Rennard et al 2007). This ineffectiveness may be due to a rather short treatment period, the choice of infliximab over other drugs, or to the complex or less significant role of TNF in progressed COPD. Future studies should sort out whether long-term treatment or treatment with different TNF antagonists are beneficial to all COPD patients or only a specific population of COPD patients (Rennard et al 2007).

Updated information shows that either the testing of these drugs is discontinued (like the antibody ABX-IL-8 against human CXCL8) or is not to be found in the public domain. Hence, little is known yet on treatment of patients with COPD with CXCL8 or CXCR2 antagonists. The small molecule CXCR2 antagonist SB-656933 (by GSK) has recently been demonstrated to inhibit the CXCL8-induced expression of CD11b molecules on peripheral blood neutrophils from COPD patients (Nicholson et al 2007). The antagonist was mentioned to enter clinical trial studies for COPD in 2005, but is not so in GSKs pipeline of 2006. AZD-8309 is a pyrimidine derivate currently in phase I clinical trial for COPD and phase II for RA. Data from these studies have not yet been published. SB-265610 is a small molecule inhibiting CXCR2. Studies demonstrated that hyperoxia in newborn rats led to pulmonary inflammation by neutrophils and the formation of ROS and RNS mediating impaired lung development and lipid peroxidation (Auten et al 2001; Liao et al 2006). Treatment with SB-265610 reduced airway neutrophilia, radical formation, lipid peroxidation and protein nitration, as well as improved conservation of lung development and lung function. This points to the importance of reducing neutrophilia in order to reduce reactive species formation, peroxidation or nitration and tissue destruction or alterations. Data from other studies supported the effectiveness of CXCL8 or CXCR2 antagonists in reducing neutrophilia in vivo in rodents and inhibition of neutrophil activation and degranulation in vitro (De Boer 2002, 2005). These data point to the potential need for development of novel antagonists of CXCR1, CXCR2 or their ligands CXCL1 and CXCL8. Recent studies showed that novel thiazolopyrimidine, cyclobutenedione (eg, SCH 527123), or imidazolylpyrimidine CXCR2 antagonists had a good oral bioavailability in rats with reasonable pharmacokinetics (half life of at least 1.2h) (Baxter et al 2006; Dwyer et al 2006; Ho et al 2006), and inhibition of CXCL1- or CXCL8-induced chemotaxis of cells (Baxter et al 2006; Dwyer et al 2006).

PMC2695202_6	"4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) is a highly reactive and specific diffusible end-product of lipid peroxidation, and is found to induce the COX-2 genes in RAW264.7 cells (Kumagai et al 2004), thus reflecting the potential role of 4-HNE as perpetrator of inflammation. Furthermore exogenous micromolar levels of 4-HNE increases the expression of several genes eg, heme oxygenase-1, collagen 1(I), and aldose reductase (Parola et al 1993; Basu-Modak et al 1996; Spycher et al 1997). Also 4-HNE has been reported to have chemotactic, cytotoxic and immunogenic properties both in vitro and in vivo (Schaur et al 1994; Steinerova et al 2001), and these effects were achieved in vitro with 4-HNE concentrations as low as 2.5 M (Muller et al 1996). Data from the authors laboratories indicate increased 4-HNE-modified protein levels in airway and alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells and neutrophils in subjects with airway obstruction compared to subjects without airway obstruction (Rahman and MacNee 2000b; Rahman et al 2002). An important outcome of 4-HNE generation is its interaction with the important thiol antioxidant glutathione (GSH) (Tjalkens et al 1999). The conjugation of 4-HNE with GSH might be one of the important mechanism whereby a cell may lose its antioxidant pool leading to oxidative stress. Interestingly, increased formation of 4-HNE has also been reported to induce expression of glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCL) gene which increases synthesis of GSH. This might be an important cellular antioxidant adaptation during oxidative stress. Inhibition of lipid peroxidation, specifically the pathways leading to the production of 4-HNE and F2-isoprostane, may therefore be important and novel targets for antioxidant therapy in inflammation and injury in patients with COPD.

Therefore, VEGF inhibitors may be of potential use for treatment of vascularization, as seen in asthma or in specific subtypes of COPD, such as chronic bronchitis, but not emphysema (Marwick et al 2006; De Boer et al 2007). Several drugs have been developed to reduce tumor growth and metastasis by impairing the neovascularization. Antagonists include those in clinical trials and in preclinical investigations. Among those in clinical trial are VEGF-Trap, bevacizumab (or: Avastin), CEP-7055, VEGF Trap, and PTK787 (Ferrara et al 2003). However, little is known yet of side effects or their efficacy in the treatment of COPD. In addition, in patients with emphysema for example, inhibitors of apoptosis are needed whereas in contrast to chronic bronchitis, expression of hypoxia-inducible factor, VEGF, and VEGFR2 may be stimulated to overcome endothelial and epithelial cell death and improve vascular restoration (Voelkel and Coll 2003). Hence, treatment with VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors should be further investigated and may be restricted to specific subtypes of chronic lung diseases.

PMC2695202_62	"In order to reverse continuing damage and remodeling needs stopping exposure to tobacco smoke by many patients with COPD. However, after smoking cessation inflammation goes on which may hamper tissue repair. The ongoing inflammation may be due to an autoimmune component and/or epigenetics alterations. However, not all patients with COPD are smokers but do suffer from tissue damage and/or remodeling. Hence, an effective treatment of patients with COPD not only needs stopping exposure to toxic compounds like smoke, but also needs reduction of excessive inflammation, oxidative status, and stimulation of parenchymal and/or airway repair (Leff 2006). This needs further development and testing of therapeutic drugs antagonizing a low antioxidant status, inflammation, and excessive remodeling. There are several small molecule compounds in clinical trials that target oxidant signaling or quench oxidants derived from inflammatory cells and cigarette smoke. Regarding inhibition of inflammation several drugs have been used successfully for treating different chronic inflammatory diseases, but not yet for COPD. As pointed out in this review, success may be hindered by the complexity of actions of eg, chemokines and antioxidants, or by a low efficacy and bioavailability of the drugs. Whereas more insight is needed in the pathogenesis of COPD or its subtypes, individualized combination therapy with such novel and specific antiinflammatory and anti-oxidant drugs may be advantageous to patients with specific phenotypes of the disease.

PMC2695202_8	"The proteinase-antiproteinase dysbalance is thought to be related to the increased proteolytic activity or protease expression observed in sputum, BAL fluid or tissue of patients with COPD, and tissue remodeling or destruction as seen in emphysema (Barnes et al 2003; Hogg 2004). Several studies reported enhanced levels or gene mutations of MMPs like MMP-1, MMP-9 or MMP-12 associated with COPD and lung function decline (Joos et al 2002; Culpitt et al 2005; Demedts et al 2006), the presence of fragments of ECM proteins like elastin or collagen (Dillon et al 1992; Stone et al 1995; Weathington et al 2006), and/or altered levels of ECM molecules in sputum, BAL fluid or lung tissue of patients with COPD (Lang et al 1994; Dentener et al 2005; Kranenburg et al 2006; Martin-Mosquero et al 2006). Extracellular matrix hyaluronan (HA) has a pro-inflammatory role and HA levels were found to be increased in sputum of COPD patients (Dentener et al 2005). Two categories of COPD subjects have been identified: one group having high HA levels and the other having moderate levels. COPD subjects exhibiting higher HA levels had low FEV1 as compared to moderated and control categories. Increased breakdown and therefore increased HA levels were further correlated with an increased expression of hyaluronidase 2 gene. Furthermore, increased HA breakdown has been associated with local inflammation and severity of COPD. Yet, a recent study demonstrated that aerosolized HA limits airspace enlargement in a mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary emphysema (Cantor et al 2005). In addition, treatment with HA partially blocked LPS (1 ng/ml) induced TNF release by blood cells from COPD patients (Dentener et al 2006). Thus the high levels of HA in COPD subjects would be a consequence of degradation of ECM, which in turn can bind to lung elastic fibers, thereby adaptively preventing their further degradation by protease (Cantor et al 1997, 2000). Targeted deletion of neutrophil elastase or MMP-12 protects from the development of cigarette smoke or gp91 deficiency-induced emphysema (Hautamaki et al 1997; Shapiro et al 2003; Kassim et al 2005). Furthermore, the structural alterations in ECM proteins may provoke an immune reaction, whereas degradation fragments generated during extensive tissue remodeling may lead to antigenic fragments also provoking an immune reaction. More specifically, exposure to reactive oxygen or nitrogen intermediates or aldehydes present in smoke or produced by inflammatory cells may lead to adduct formation of structural (lipo)proteins in the lung eg, as a result of lipid peroxidation or protein carbonyl formation (Rahman and Adcock 2006). In turn, this may result in the formation of neo-epitopes of ECM proteins (Kirkham et al 2004; Morquette et al 2006). The induction of neo-antigens upon tobacco smoke exposure may lead to specific B and T cell clones that provoke autoimmune reactions. Alternatively, during embryogenesis specific B and T cells are being selected and generated by peptide fragments of extracellular matrix components secreted by lung epithelial cells. At that moment, the immune system is tolerant to these peptides. Upon smoke exposure, these B and/or T cells may be activated causing the inflammatory phenotype and specific lung parenchymal destruction as seen in emphysema. Some of the mechanisms are outlined in Figure 1. As COPD is detected in an advanced form only at later age, other models are needed to study these and other pathogenetic mechanisms of COPD.

PMC2695202_9	"Inflammation is one of the hallmarks of COPD. Inflammatory cells are known to migrate to chemotactic gradients, or to express and produce pro- or anti-inflammatory proteins, MMPs and other proteases, growth factors, antibacterial proteins like -defensins, -defensins and cathelicidins, and/or to degranulate by a plethora of molecules including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and arachidonic acid derivates (like prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes) (De Boer 2002; Bals and Hiemstra 2006; Rahman and Adcock 2006; Rolin et al 2006). Classical cytokines include TNF, interleukins (ILs) and interferons (IFNs). Chemokines can be subdivided into four subfamilies based on their structural homology around 4 cysteine residues: -C-, -CC-, -CXC-, and -CXXXC-, in which X substitutes for any amino acid. The major subfamilies are the -CXC- (or:  chemokines, and the -CC- chemokines (or: -) chemokines) (De Boer 2002). Gene expression of cytokines and chemokines is regulated by transcription factors including AP-1 and Fos, and signal transduction kinases like mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38, Jun kinase (JNK), and NF-B, and are synthesized by both structural cells (such as fibroblasts, epithelial, endothelial, and muscle cells) and inflammatory cells of the innate and the adaptive immune system. They act via specific membrane-bound receptors resulting in cell specific reactions. In patients with COPD, protein and/or mRNA levels of different cytokines and chemokines have been found to be altered compared with subjects without COPD (Table 1).

However there was an unexpected 29% greater risk of dropout from the study in the tiotropium arm. The study found that at the end of 2 years, there was a 2.1 unit (p = 0.038) improvement in quality of life as measured by the SGRQ in the SFC arm compared to the tiotropium arm but this may have been due to a healthy survivor effect, as patients whose wellbeing was deteriorating more rapidly withdrew sooner, more so in the tiotropium arm.47 There was also a 3% mortality rate on treatment in the SFC arm compared to 6% in the tiotropium arm (p = 0.008), which was also unexpected.

However, there was a significant decrease in exacerbations requiring hospitalization in the SFC containing arm (rate ratio 0.53; 95% CI 0.33086), thus suggesting that addition of SFC reduced the severity of exacerbations which was supported by a significant reduction in all-cause hospitalization. There were also differences in favor of tiotropium SFC in HRQoL. Thus it appears that addition of SFC to tiotropium decreases health burden in COPD. There was no mortality difference on treatment between the two arms. The results of the OPTIMAL study have been supported by two recent studies of triple therapy which showed physiological benefit for the triple therapy combination.138,139 The UPLIFT study design allowed use of other inhaled therapy in both arms and 74% of subjects in this study were on ICS, and thus the UPLIFT study may be seen to extend the results of the OPTIMAL study in that UPLIFT showed that there was a 14% decrease in exacerbation rates on top of usual care (p < 0.001) compared to placebo.136

In analogy with the RCRI, these pulmonary risk scores were established by assigning points to several predictive factors for pneumonia (14 variables) and respiratory failure (12 variables) (Table 2). Overall, the major contributors to PPCs were related to an advanced age (>70 yrs), the type of surgery (vascular, thoracic), the presence of COPD, renal failure or poor nutritional status as well as the occurrence of major intraoperative blood loss (>4 units packed blood cells).

The overall incidence of PPC was 6.8% (ranging from 2% to 19%) (Smetana et al 2006). Not surprisingly, these clinical studies were heterogenous regarding their sample sizes (median 148 patients per group), study objectives, definitions of PPCs and inclusion criteria. In contrast with cardiac risk stratification where the extent of heart disease largely determined postoperative cardiac outcome, procedure-related factors largely dominated patients related comorbidities to predict PPCs. Peripheral and orthopedic procedures were considered at low-risk to develop PPCs whereas surgical interventions involving the thorax, the upper abdomen, as well as the head and neck regions, were more likely to interfere with respiratory function, particularly in the context of extended tissue trauma, large body fluid shifts and multiple transfusion. Among patient-related predictors, the following items have been found to be independently associated with PPCs : 1) advanced age (70 yrs), 2) the American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status classification (classes 2), 3) a history of congestive heart failure, 4) the presence of COPD, 5) a poor general condition and 6) a low blood albumin level (<35 g/L).

For instance, the airway closing capacity increases with age as does the perfusion in lung units with low ventilation/perfusion ratios (VA/Q) that result in increasing venous admixture and, in turn deterioration in blood oxygenation (Hedenstierna and Edmark 2005).

In addition to the short- and long term death toll, these major cardiac and pulmonary complications implicate an enormous economic burden as a result of patients admission to intensive care units (ICU), prolonged hospital stay and use of expensive therapeutic treatment (Schweizer et al 2002; Fleischmann et al 2003).

Following anesthesia induction  with or without muscular paralysis  all respiratory muscles being relaxed, there is a fall in the functional reserve capacity (FRC) with a consistent cephalad shift of the dependent part of the diaphragm while the nondependent diaphragmatic part moves slightly downwards or remains static (Warner 2002). With mechanical ventilation, the positive transpulmonary pressure causes the greatest displacement of the nondependent part, although with large tidal volume, all parts of the diaphragm move equally (piston-like motion).

Although the development of respiratory dysfunction may forecast significant PPCs, it may also reflect the natural postoperative recovery processes. Transient and self-limiting impairment in spirometric values, respiratory muscle strength and gas exchange should be considered as part of the physiological responses to surgery. For instance, most patients undergoing cardiothoracic or abdominal operations present some degree of hypoxemia and diffuse micro-atelectasis that will barely impact on the postoperative clinical course.

Few sedative drugs are devoid of central respiratory depressive effects: droperidol potentiates the hypoxic ventilatory response by blocking the action of endogenously released dopamine and the histamine-antagonist, diphenhydramine, counteracts the alfentanil-induced decrease in the slope of the CO2 ventilatory response (Babenco et al 1998).

In these experimental conditions, redistribution of pulmonary blood flow towards poorly oxygenated regions contributes to widen the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (PA-aO2) and to cause arterial oxygen desaturation by increasing intra-pulmonary shunting (Moudgil et al 2005). In clinical practice, only mild impairment in blood gas exchange is observed under lower concentrations of inhalational anesthetics (11.5 MAC), because the direct anesthetic-induced inhibition of the HPV response is partially opposed by the reduced mixed venous oxygen pressure consequent to the anesthetic-induced myocardial depression.

As a rule, most COPD patients exhibit weaker HPV and blunted ventilatory responses to CO2 and hypoxia. Flattening and shortening of the diaphragm represent mechanical disadvantages whereas the diaphragmatic pumping efficiency may be impaired by deconditioning, insufficient muscular O2 delivery and enhanced muscle catabolism as a result of bed rest, heart failure as well as the neuroendocrine and inflammatory response to surgery. Nevertheless, the contractile efficiency within the crural and costal parts of the diaphragm is partly maintained by length adaptation processes whereby chronically shortened muscular fibers lose excess sarcomeres and with time, the remaining sarcomeres are restored to the optimal operating length, generating a virtual normal contraction (Gunnarsson, Tokics, Lundquist et al 1991; Gorman et al 2002).

These respiratory changes peak within the first 2448 h and normalize over the next 410 days. Typically, minute ventilation is maintained by increasing the respiratory rate at smaller tidal volumes whereas the reduction in muscular diaphragmatic activity is associated with the inspiratory expansion of the thorax instead of the normal abdominal excursion (Nimmo and Drummond 1996; Hedenstierna and Rothen 2000; Groeben, Schafer et al 2002).

Not surprisingly, diaphragmatic function is less impaired and respiratory volumes are better preserved after minimally-invasive surgical approaches given the lesser inflammatory and neurohumoral responses (Ciofolo et al 1990; Hasukic et al 2002). Conversely, prolonged surgical stress and septic events activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leading to progressive atrophy of respiratory muscles via the production of glucocorticoids and the release of cytokines, nitric oxide and oxygen-derived free radicals (Lanone et al 2005). In these critically-ill patients, the fall in maximal diaphragmatic force over several days parallels the reduction in muscular mass as a result of oxidative myofibrillar injuries, increased protease activity and downregulation of the insulin-like growth factor-I. In an attempt to limit this ongoing wasting process, the release of beta-endorphin decreases the activation of respiratory muscles, by changing the pattern of breathing which becomes more rapid and shallow. In addition to the neurohumoral and inflammatory interferences, sustained inspiratory overload may promote diaphragmatic muscular fatigue whereas electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia), nutritional defects and circulatory failure may further compromise the contracting capacity of the respiratory muscles.

Indeed, following abdominal surgery, provision of TEA is accompanied by slowing the respiratory rate, increasing tidal volume and restoration of diaphragmatic function (electromyographic activity and transdiaphragmatic pressure). Besides interrupting the afferent inputs originating from the thorax and abdomen, TEA using high concentrations of local anesthetics also blocks the efferent output reaching the abdominal expiratory muscles and intercostal muscles, thereby limiting the ability to cough and to clear bronchial secretions (Polaner et al 1993). Moreover, it has been speculated that abdominal motor blockade would facilitate downward diaphragmatic displacement by suppressing the interference of sustained tonic abdominal muscular activity on the indices of diaphragmatic activity rather than by changing the real diaphragmatic activity.

Smoking cessation is successful in less than 30% of cases. Fewer tissue-healing problems and PPCs have been observed only after more than 8 weeks of smoking cessation, compared with non-smoking patients (Moller et al 2002; Barrera et al 2005). Overwhelming health benefits in smoking cessation accrue with increasing duration of abstinence. Firstly, carboxyhemoglobin levels decrease and the excitatory effects of nicotine are abolished within 48 hours.

In these large-volume hospitals and health networks, better results in terms of patient mortality/morbidity data and cost containment can be achieved by adopting stringent safety practices, implementing organ protective strategies, standardizing the processes of care and defining clinical pathways for homogeneous groups of patients. In several leading American hospitals, health care quality-improvement projects are focused on specific targets such as the perioperative use of beta-blockers, computerization of the medical and nursing files as well as the 24h availability of high-dependency units.

The continuous airflow from a bi-level positive airway pressure ventilator (BiPAP: two different levels of inspiratory and expiratory airway pressure) may deliver adaptive pressures to prevent the dynamic airway collapse which tend to occur with standard ventilation in COPD patients (Ferrer et al 2002). The flow triggering during BiPAP allows spontaneous breathing throughout the mechanical ventilatory cycle, enabling unrestricted movement of the diaphragm.

Similar protective ventilatory settings have been demonstrated to blunt the pulmonary inflammatory responses; accordingly, BiPAP or PV with low tidal volume and lung recruitment maneuvers are currently advocated during major operations, particularly lung resection in COPD patients (Licker, de Perrot et al 2003; Fernandez-Perez et al 2006).

Although formation of resorption atelectasis occurs in all patients breathing pure O2 within 7 min after anesthesia induction, the amount of atelectatic areas is much less in patients ventilated with 80% O2 inspiratory concentration and almost absent in those ventilated with 60%.129 Accordingly, prevention of complete alveolar gas resorption and preservation of bactericidal activity of inflammatory cells can be achieved by setting the inspiratory O2 fraction between 50%80% and by performing periodic vital capacity manoeuvers.

The use of intraoperative central neuraxial techniques (spinal/epidural) has been associated with reduced operative mortality rates and fewer episodes of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and stroke as well as a lower need for blood transfusion. Likewise, maintenance of thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) for several days after major abdominal and thoracic surgery has been shown to reduce the operative mortality rate as well as the incidence of myocardial infarct, arrhythmia, atelectasis, bronchopneumonia and respiratory failure (Beattie et al 2001; Rigg et al 2002; Lawrence et al 2006; Licker et al 2006). By blocking the afferent nociceptive stimuli and inhibiting the efferent sympathetic outflow, TEA affords cardiac and pulmonary protection as demonstrated by improvement of myocardial oxygen balance, inhibition of platelet hyperaggregability, limitation of myocardial infarct size and preservation of diaphragmatic function (Pansard et al 1993; Polaner et al 1993; Groban et al 1999; Liu et al 2004). In addition, the time to extubation is shortened in patients with TEA as lower doses of opiates and anesthetic drugs are administered intraoperatively. Faster recovery of bowel motility allows early resumption of oral intake and blunting of protein catabolism facilitates rapid mobilization, avoiding the consequences of bed rest with muscle wasting, fatigue and venous thrombosis (Carli et al 2002).

A recent meta-analysis including 668 surgical patients failed to document any benefit in terms of mortality and major cardiopulmonary complications following cardiac surgery (Liu et al 2004). Nevertheless, much lower doses of opiates are required to provide analgesia through the epidural/spinal route. For instance, intrathecal morphine is 100 times more potent than after systemic injection, due to the presence of opioid receptors in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. Clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of intra-thecal opiates on several surrogate endpoints: modulating the perioperative stress response, alleviating pain for the first 24 hours after surgery, shortening the extubation time and improvement of the early postoperative respiratory function (Liu et al 2004). Importantly, the dose-related respiratory depressive effect of intrathecal morphine mandates close monitoring within the first 24 hours after the injection of doses exceeding 0.5 mg (Bailey et al 1993).

For understandable reasons, fear of spinal hematoma and nerve injuries will continue to discourage some anesthesiologists to perform regional anesthetic techniques in low risk patients in whom various combinations of parenteral opiates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and paracetamol might be preferred. In contrast, in patients at higher risk for cardiopulmonary complications, the risk-benefit analysis speaks in favor of central neuraxial blockade. These important issues should be discussed preoperatively with each patient. For instance, surgical candidates undergoing major aortic surgery have an average 3%5% risk of myocardial infarct and 5%10% risk of PPCs. Considering the fact that central neuraxial blockade confers a median 30% to 50% relative risk reduction for cardiac and pulmonary complications, then one myocardial infarct and one PPC can be avoided for every 30 to 60 treated patients.

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) defined chronic bronchitis in clinical terms including chronic cough lasting at least three months for at least two years. By contrast, the ATS defined emphysema in anatomic terms of enlarged alveolar spaces and loss of alveolar walls. Neither definition used any physiologic criteria. Asthma was described as a state of airway hyperresponsiveness to a variety of stimuli. Asthmatic bronchitis was considered an overlapping condition (Committee on Diagnostic Standards for Nontuberculous Respiratory Diseases 1962). (The author had the privilege of attending the deliberations of the ATS committee as a Resident in Medicine in 1962 in Memphis Tennessee during the time of the annual VA-Armed Forces Annual Conference on the Treatment of Tuberculosis.)

This was somewhat of a fortuitous discovery, since he was not trying to produce emphysema, but was hoping to determine the effect of papain on the fibrosis associated with experimental silicosis that he was studying. Grosss work produced emphysema, due to proteolytic damage of elastin and thus was the forerunner of the protease  antiprotease therapy of the pathogenesis, as described by Laurel and Erickson (1963) in Sweden with alpha-one-antitrypsin deficiency and emphysema. Other investigations also used elastases to produce experimental emphysema (Snider and Sherter 1977). Many genetic, infectious, and immunologic models in small animals followed and continue to be investigated at the present time. A recent model employing methylprednisolone to produce emphysema in rats induces matrix metalloproteinase and can be prevented by a metal proteinase inhibitor (Choe et al 2003). The concept that emphysema is an autoimmune vascular disease has been offered as one pathway in pathogenesis (Voelkel and Taraseviciene-Stewart 2005).

Cosio et al (1978) provided his grading photomicrographs of mild, moderate, and severe inflammation and mild, moderate, and severe fibrosis of small airways. Emphysema was found to relate to a reduction in elastic recoil and in the percentage of the predicted FEV1 (Silvers et al 1974, 1980; Petty et al 1984). Elastic recoil was inversely proportional to the closing capacity and the slope of phase III disease (Petty et al 1980). In addition, the maximum expiratory flow volume was not related to emphysema (Petty 1984). Fairly good correlations were found among the FEV1, FVC, and static lung recoil at 70% of inflation (Petty et al 1984). Increased lung size (TLC and FR) were related to loss of elastic recoils, but not to airflow obstruction (Petty et al 1987).

Early in the course, damage to the structure leads to a loss of elastic recoil (Saetta, Ghezzo, et al 1985; Saetta, Shiner, et al 1985; Petty et al 1987). The lungs begin to increase in size, and the FVC increases (Petty et al 1987). This results in early physiologic alterations that can be readily identified by simple spirometry (Burrows et al 1987). By the time clinical signs are present, COPD is often in a moderate-to-advanced stage (Mannino et al 2000).

PMC2706597_34	"Pathologic evidence of emphysema can be derived from CT studies or from resectional material, such as when solitary nodules are removed (Cosio et al 1978, 1986). The most practical way to diagnose and to access the functional progress of COPD is by spirometry. The initial smoking-induced injury to the human lungs appears to be in the small conducting air passages and surrounding alveoli. When alveoli become damaged or lost, the elastic supporting structure of the lung is reduced (Figures 1 and 2). This results in both a loss of elastic recoil and in increased airways resistance since airways are no longer tethered by the radial traction forces of the surrounding alveolar attachments. Mural inflammation of small airways and airways remodeling also reduce the airway lumen.

PMC2706597_35	"Thus, the interrelated causes of airflow obstruction in COPD patients include a combination of airways inflammation and remodeling, bronchospasm, mucous hyper-secretion, and loss of elastic recoil.

PMC2706597_36	"It deserves emphasis that early stages of emphysema are characterized by both hyperinflation and an increased FVC (Burrows et al 1987; Petty et al 1987). This is the reason why the FEV1/FVC ratio is such a sensitive test for early stages of airflow obstruction. An FEV1/FVC of <70% heralds the onset of rapid declines in FEV1 over the course of a 10-year period (Burrows et al 1987). The time course of these changes in alveoli and small airways is illustrated in Figure 3. Thirty or more years of progressive loss in airflow may take place before the threshold to dyspnea on exertion occurs, which is usually at <1.5 L/s and may be as low as 1.0 L/s in smaller persons.

Thus, the inflammatory processes of COPD are markedly different from those of asthma. Inflammation in asthma consists of more corticosteroid-responsive cells and mediators, such as mast cell-activated eosinophils, T-helper type 2 lymphocytes (CD4 phenotype), and a number of cytokines whose production is decreased by use of corticosteroids.

According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2000, COPD was responsible for an estimated 2.75 million deaths worldwide (Lopez et al 2006), half of which were documented in the Western Pacific region. An earlier study estimated that 2.2 million deaths worldwide were caused by COPD (Murray and Lopez 1997a). In the USA, COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of death and is projected to be the third by 2020 (US Department of Health and Human Services 2003).

PMC2707151_1	"According to the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines, COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. This airflow limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases. Although COPD predominantly affects the lungs, it is also associated with significant systemic consequences. Important symptoms of COPD range from chronic cough and sputum production to dyspnea. The single most important risk factor is a history of exposure to tobacco smoke; other important factors include occupational exposure to dusts and chemicals, lower socio-economic status, and genetic predisposition.

There are strong data that many deaths attributed to asthma, particularly in patients aged over 65 years, are due to misclassification of other respiratory diseases as asthma (Jenkins et al 1992; Smyth et al 1996; Reid et al 1998). For example, in the study by Reid and colleagues, based on death certificates in northern England, COPD was considered to be the true cause of 28 of the 55 deaths in which asthma was certified as the direct cause. Such diagnostic transfer over-represents asthma-related deaths and under-represents COPD-related deaths. Finally, difficulties in verifying death certificates and disease coding practices are a considerable potential problem in international mortality studies that include data from diverse national sources.

The WHO previously published mortality rates for the combined category of bronchitis, emphysema and asthma (ICD codes 490493), which omits the largest category of COPD mortality (ICD code 519.3 in the eighth revision and ICD code 496 in the ninth revision).

The original GBD study accessed various national and international data sources and requested expert opinion to estimate worldwide and regional cause-of-death patterns in 1990 for more than 100 causes of death, including COPD. In 1990, 2 211 000 deaths were attributed to COPD, representing 4.4% of all deaths recorded and making COPD then the sixth leading cause of worldwide mortality.

Half of these deaths occurred in the Western Pacific region and the majority of these in China, where the incidence of COPD among subjects aged  60 years is 23 times higher than in other WHO regions. The updated report also shows about 400 000 deaths attributed to COPD each year in industrialized countries.

Recently published data from the Latin American Project for the Investigation of Obstructive Lung Disease (PLATINO) prevalence study may support this notion (Menezes et al 2005).

The progression of the disease varies by COPD phenotype, a concept that is currently poorly understood. From the early stages of COPD and as the disease develops, chronic inflammation of the airways and lung parenchyma result in progressive airflow limitation with an accelerated rate of decline in FEV1 and increased hyperinflation, which cause breathing difficulties and reduce exercise tolerance (Hogg et al 2004; Sutherland and Cherniack 2004). Pathological changes are observed in the central and peripheral airways, the parenchyma, and the pulmonary vasculature. In addition to inflammation, an imbalance of proteinases and antiproteinases in the lungs and oxidative stress are also important in the pathogenesis of COPD (Repine et al 1997). These pathological changes result in the well recognized physiological abnormalities of COPD: mucous hypersecretion and ciliary dysfunction; airflow limitation and hyperinflation; destruction of alveoli and emphysema; gas exchange abnormalities; pulmonary hypertension; and various systemic effects (Matsuba et al 1989; ODonnell et al 2001; Hogg et al 2004).

However, there are few data on the effect of smoking cessation on COPD mortality among people with COPD. Follow-up of the Lung Health Study cohort of almost 6000 smokers with asymptomatic airway obstruction showed that a 10-week smoking cessation intervention program significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared with usual care, with a 14-year follow-up (Anthonisen et al 2005).

Although smoking cessation reduced the incidence of most causes of death, only the reduction in respiratory deaths was statistically significant (Anthonisen et al 2005). The mortality rate for respiratory deaths unrelated to lung cancer was 0.56/1000 person-years in the smoking intervention group and 1.08/1000 person-years in the usual care group (p=0.01).

In a population-based cohort study of data from Canadian databases on 22 620 elderly patients with COPD, patients who received ICS therapy within 90 days of hospital discharge were 29% (95% CI: 22%, 35%) less likely to die during a one-year follow-up than those who did not receive ICS (Sin and Tu 2001). Another Canadian cohort study used hospital discharge data to identify 6740 patients aged  65 years who had been hospitalized for COPD (Sin and Man 2003b). Analysis of all-cause mortality data for this cohort showed a 25% decrease in mortality in patients treated with an ICS following discharge from hospital.

Suissa, Fan and colleagues have criticized these studies as having been designed with bias (known as immortal time bias) which could lead to an overestimation of an effect of ICS. Immortal time bias arises when subjects cannot by definition incur the outcome event under the study (ie, death). For example, if a study design stipulates that a new treatment (eg, ICS) is added to a patients care at some time after an initial index date (ie death) then anyone dying before initiation of ICS would be allocated to a control group rather than the intervention group. This bias might lead to an overestimation of the effect of an ICS.

PMC2707151_49	"Recently, Kiri and co-workers explored the extent to which immortal time bias is responsible for the beneficial effects of ICS in patients with COPD (Kiri et al 2005b). Two designs free of any immortal time bias were used on the GPRD COPD patient data. Design one used only patients whose treatment status was defined on the same day of discharge to obtain a matched cohort based on propensity scores. Design two used all patients who had died or been re-hospitalized and matched each case with up to four non-cases by randomly sampling from the cohort risk sets, irrespective of treatment status. From the propensity scores matched-cohort analysis, treatment with ICS resulted in a HR estimate of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.93). The matched nested case-control analysis gave rate ratio estimates of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.90). The authors concluded that a beneficial association between ICS and the risk of death/re-hospitalization in patients with COPD does indeed exist and is free from immortal time bias.

Clinical trial data and extensive review of clinical patients show that a range of factors including lung failure, cor pulmonale, cardiovascular disease, and lung cancer are all important contributors to death in patients with COPD (Braghiroli et al 1997; Zielinski et al 1997; Waterhouse et al 1999; Anthonisen et al 2005). Large population-based studies have also reported on the causes of death in COPD patients. Hansell et al (2003a) recently analyzed death certificate data in England and Wales between 1993 and 1999 that included more than 300 000 deaths in patients with COPD. The aims of the study were to quantify the extent to which obstructive lung disease (OLD) contributed to death and to better characterize specific causes of death in OLD patients. The authors noted that approximately 60% of deaths in COPD patients were attributed to COPD itself, while 25% of the patients died as a result of diseases of the circulatory system and more than 5% of deaths were attributed to neoplasms (Hansell et al 2003a).

In a retrospective cohort study of 556 patients receiving oral steroids for COPD, maintenance treatment with oral steroids (administered without ICS) was associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR=2.34; 95% CI: 1.24, 4.44 for a prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg per day) (Schols et al 2001). This risk appeared to be dose-dependent and was almost doubled in patients who received a prednisone equivalent dose of 15 mg per day (RR=4.03, 95% CI: 1.99, 8.15). However, the risk of mortality appeared to be smaller when oral steroids were administered with ICS and the use of ICS alone was associated with decreased mortality (RR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.70). A retrospective study of 403 Swedish COPD patients receiving LTOT found that increased mortality was associated with the use of oral steroids in women (RR=1.49; 95% CI: 1.00, 2.22), but not in men (RR=1.08; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.59) (Strm 1998).

It is likely that the impact of COPD has been under-estimated due to a lack of accurate epidemiologic data from some countries, misdiagnosis, and inconsistent use of ICD codes when reporting causes of death in patients with COPD. Particularly worrying is the marked increase in deaths (in most, but not all countries) due to COPD over the past couple of decades, a trend that is predicted to continue. Also cause for concern is the dramatic rise in COPD mortality seen in women in many countries. In addition to the considerable mortality and morbidity burden of COPD, this condition also incurs significant financial costs associated with the care of patients and lost productivity of patients and carers.

PMC2707800_10	"There are no significant differences between the various 2-agonists as far as selectivity for 2-adrenoceptors is concerned, with the exception of metaproterenol and iso-etharine, which are less selective (Undem and 1 2001). Short-acting 2-agonists have a bronchodilatory effect within 1 to 5 minutes and which lasts for up to 4 hours (Rennard 2004). Long-acting inhaled 2-adrenergic agonists such as salmeterol and formoterol have a prolonged bronchodilatory effect for approximately 12 hours. Unlike salmeterol which has a slow onset of action, formoterol has a rapidly occurring bronchodilatory effect similar to that of short-acting 2-agonists (Undem and Lichtenstein 2001; Rennard 2004). Selective 2-agonists mainly work by stimulating the 2-adrenoceptors on the airway smooth muscle cells. The formation of the drug-receptor complex activates a stimulatory protein (Gs) which binds to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) with activation of the adenylate cyclase which leads to an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels which, in turn, activates a cAMP-dependant protein kinase (PKA) (Johnson and Coleman 1995). Activation of the latter causes myosin light chain kinase phosphorylation with a reduction in the affinity of this enzyme for the calciumcalmodulin complex, a reduction in the formation of active myosin light chain kinase, a reduction in myosin phosphorylation and, finally, a reduction in the interaction of actin and myosin filaments with consequent bronchodilation. In addition, PKA stimulation causes a reduction in intracellular calcium ion levels because of increased extrusion of calcium from the cell, reduction in the entry of calcium into the cell, and increase in the uptake of calcium by the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which is the site at which calcium ions are deposited within the cell.
"	
PMC2707800_11	"The reduction in the concentration of intracellular calcium causes a reduction in the formation of the calciumcalmodulin complex which produces the previously described effects. In addition to this main bronchodilation mechanism of selective 2-agonists, other mechanisms may, in theory, contribute to reducing airway obstruction. Stimulation of 2-adrenoceptors also increases potassium channel conduction with hyperpolarization and relaxation of the airway smooth muscle (Kume et al 1994). This effect is, in part, independent from the increase in cAMP levels (Kume et al 1994). The activation of 2-receptors on inflammatory cells such as mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes cause an increase in cAMP levels and subsequent inhibition of the release of inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes, histamine and cytokines (Hughes et al 1983; Barnes 1999). 2-agonists increase mucociliary clearance, decrease microvascular permeability and may inhibit phospholipase A2 with subsequent reduction in the synthesis of leukotrienes, prostaglandins and thromboxane A2, which are important inflammatory mediators (Seale 1988). The importance of these mechanisms on the therapeutic effect of 2-agonists in humans, particularly in COPD, is not known.

PMC2707800_12	"Inhalation limits the absorption and therefore the systematic side effects of 2-agonists. However, only about 10% of the aerosol enters the respiratory tract while the remainder is swallowed and may be absorbed in the intestinal tract with consequent systemic side effects. Furthermore, aerosolized particles less than 1m in diameter reach the alveoli and may be absorbed in the pulmonary capillaries. The main side effect of selective 2-agonists administered by inhalation at clinical doses is muscular tremor. However, this tends to diminish in intensity during prolonged treatment. This phenomenon is known as drug tolerance. It is not know if drug tolerance is due to the down regulation of the 2-adrenoceptors on the muscle cytoskeleton or to adaptation phenomena in the central nervous system. Tachycardia is uncommon in clinical doses of 2-agonists administered by inhalation. The absorption of 2-agonists may cause tachycardia by stimulating the cardiac 1-adrenoceptors, particularly at higher doses when relative selectivity for 2-adrenoceptors is lost. Although there are fewer cardiac 2-adrenoceptors, their stimulation may also contribute to tachycardia (Undem and Lichtenstein 2001). This type of side effect is particularly relevant in patients with ischemic heart disease or pre-existing arrhythmias. In these patients, 2-agonists need to be administered with caution, even when inhaled. Bronchodilation may cause ventilation/perfusion mismatch with a consequent drop in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen. This is generally transitory and of little importance. Other side effects of systemically delivered 2-agonists, such as hypokalemia, increase in the plasma concentrations of glucose, lactose, and free fatty acids are much less common when 2-agonists are delivered by inhalation.

PMC2707800_13	"Antimuscarinics are delivered in the same way as bronchodilators. Antimuscarinics are quaternary ammonium derivatives which, after inhalation, undergo <1% absorption from the pulmonary or gastrointestinal tract. The parasympathetic nervous system has a role in the regulation of the bronchial tone. Vagal fibres activate nicotinic and M1 muscarinic receptors on the parasympathetic ganglia of the respiratory tract; short postganglionic fibers release acetylcholine which stimulates the M3 muscarinic receptors on the airway smooth muscle cells with consequent increase in motility. In addition, the airway submucosal glands have M3 muscarinic receptors. M3 muscarinic receptor stimulation increases bronchial secretion. Inflammatory mediators such as eicosanoids, histamine, and bradykinin may further produce parasympathetic reflexes which partly explains their bronchoconstriction effect. Antimuscarinic bronchodilators are non-selective antagonists of cholinergic muscarinic receptors. Their effect on airway obstruction is mainly due both to M3 muscarinic receptor antagonism in the airway smooth muscle cells, with consequent bronchodilation, and to M3 muscarinic receptor antagonism in the cells of the submucosal glands, with a reduction in the basal and stimulated cholinergic parasympathetic activity with consequent reduction in airway obstruction. Unlike atropine, antimuscarinic bronchodilators do not have an inhibitory effect on mucociliary clearance. The reason for this difference is not known. The effectiveness of antimuscarinic drugs depends on the role that cholinergic vagal tone has in the pathophysiology of bronchial obstruction. Antimuscarinic bronchodilators are generally considered to be more effective for COPD than for asthma. This could be partly due to the different pathophysiological role of the parasympathetic vagal system in these two diseases. The aerosol inhalation of ipratropium has a maximum effect 3060 minutes after administration; its duration of action is 3 to 6 hours, making administration of the drug necessary 3 to 4 times a day. Ipratropium generally produces the same moderate bronchodilation as obtained with maximum doses of 2-agonists (Undem and Lichenstein 2001). Oxitropium produces similar pharmacological effects to ipratropium and can be administered twice a day. Tiotropium bromide, a new long-acting anticholinergic drug, which can be administered just once a day, has similar or greater efficacy compared with other bronchodilators (Calverley 2000) and is useful in combination with formoterol for COPD treatment (van Noord et al 2006). A randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to assess whether adding salmeterol or salmeterolfluticasone to chronic therapy with tiotropium would provide additional clinical benefit to patients with moderate to severe COPD is currently being carried out (Aaron et al 2004). Tiotropium improves sleeping arterial oxygen saturation (McNicholas et al 2004) and, in combination with pulmonary rehabilitation, exercise tolerance in patients with COPD (Casaburi et al 2005). Tiotropium bromide is indicated in the maintenance treatment of COPD, but it is not effective in relieving acute bronchospasms. However, as is the case with asthmatic patients, some authors raised doubts about chronic administration of bronchodilators which could be associated with worsening COPD (van Schayck et al 1991). Because of their negligible absorption, antimuscarinics rarely cause systemic side effects and are generally well tolerated. Possible side effects include dry mouth, nausea, constipation, and headache (RS 2003). Antimuscarinic bronchodilators should be administered with caution in glaucoma, benign prostatic hypertrophy and urinary obstruction (RS 2003; Rennard 2004). Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with nebulized ipratropium, particularly when given with nebulized salbutamol.

PMC2707800_14	"Theophylline, a methylxanthine, is one of the least expensive bronchodilators. Given its very low solubility in water, theophylline is administered intravenously as aminophylline. Aminophylline is a theophylline and ethylenediamine mixture, which is 20 times more soluble than theophylline alone. The bronchodilatory effect of theophylline is due both to relatively non-selective inhibition of cyclic neucleotide phosphodiesterases and to competitive antagonism of adenosine receptors (Barnes 2003). At least eleven phosphodiesterase isozymes have been identified (Soderling and Beavo 2000). The inhibition of phosphodiesterase isozymes type III and IV causes relaxation of the airway smooth muscle cells in vitro (Torphy et al 1993). Selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors for COPD are currently in clinical trials (Lipworth 2005). Adenosine receptor antagonism also contributes to the brochodilatory effect of theophylline (Feoktistov et al 1998). In addition to bronchodilation, theophylline may have anti-inflammatory effects at lower plasma concentrations in the respiratory tract as shown by the reduction both in the number of neutrophils and in the interleukin-8 concentration in induced sputum from COPD patients, where the same effects cannot be obtained after inhalation of high glucocorticoid doses (Barnes 2003). In vitro studies have shown that low doses of theophylline may enhance the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids and antagonize the resistance to corticosteroids caused by smoking in COPD patients by activating histone deacetylases (Barnes 2003, 2006).

PMC2707800_15	"Theophylline is generally administered orally in conventional form or, more frequently, through sustained-release preparations or intravenously (like aminophylline) (Undem and Lichtenstein 2001). Sustained-release preparations are available for administration every 8, 12, or 24 hours. Intravenous administration of theophylline must be given very slowly, over at least a 20 minute period (RS 2003), because of the risk of serious toxic effects such as arrhythmias and convulsions. Inhalation of theophylline is not effective and intramuscular injection is not possible because of its irritant effect at the site of injection. Absorption of theophylline from conventional formulations is fast and complete with a plasma concentration peak within two hours of administration. Absorption of theophylline from sustained-release preparations has a large interindividual variability, for this reason, dosage must be changed to suit the individual patient. Theophylline is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism (less than 15% is excreted in the urine unchanged) (Undem and Lichtenstein 2001). There is wide variation in the rate of elimination of theophylline. The half-life of elimination is on average 8 to 9 hours in adults and about 3.5 hours in children (Undem and Lichtenstein 2001). The half-life is increased in heart or liver failure, viral infections, in the elderly and with concomitant administration of some drugs such as cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, fluvoxamine, and oral contraceptives. The half-life of elimination of theophylline is decreased in smokers and in chronic alcoholics, and with concomitant administration of drugs such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, and barbiturates (RS 2003). In addition to bronchodilation, theophylline may increase cardiac contractility, have a psychostimulant or diuretic effect, and increase diaphragmic contractility. A possible therapeutic importance for COPD has been attributed to this last effect. However, theophylline has some disadvantages including its low therapeutic index which limits its administration. For this reason, and because of the large interindividual variability in its bioavailability, therapeutic monitoring of plasma theophylline concentrations is required. This involves taking regular blood samples after the theophylline concentrations reach a steady-state to ensure that the plasma theophylline concentration is within the therapeutic range for plasma theophylline concentrations for which the majority of patients obtain therapeutic effects without toxic effects, even though side effects are found with therapeutic concentrations. The therapeutic range for theophylline is between 1020 g/ml. Toxic side effects are associated with theophylline concentrations of more than 25 g/ml. The risk of serious toxic effects, such as arrhythmias and convulsions, is high with theophylline concentrations of more than 40 g/ml. At therapeutic plasma concentrations the main side effects of theophylline include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, agitation, palpitation, and hypotension (Undem and Lichtenstein 2001).

PMC2707800_16	"Inhaled glucocorticoids currently available include beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone propionate and triamcinolone acetonide. There are no significant differences between these drugs in terms of their efficacy and tolerability (Undem and Lichtenstein 2001; RS 2003). Mometasone and ciclesonide, two new glucocorticoids in advanced clinical trials, seem to have a longer duration of action with the possibility of once a day administration. Ciclesonide is a prodrug which is activated by a pulmonary esterase, with the possibility of increased selectivity of action and reduced systemic side effects resulting from glucocorticoid absorption. Glucocorticoids do not cause relaxation of the airway smooth muscle and therefore have no effect on acute bronchoconstriction. Glucocorticoids bind to specific cytoplasmic receptor proteins, which, in turn bind to regulatory proteins such as heat shock proteins and an immunophyllin (Undem and Lichtenstein 2001). The glucocorticoidreceptor interaction causes a receptor conformational change which leads to regulatory protein detachment, dimerization of the glucocorticoid receptor complexes and translocation to the nucleus where the drug-receptor complex binds to specific regulatory DNA sequences (glucocorticoid response elements, GRE), which modulate the expression of the adjacent genes. The time required for gene expression and protein synthesis explains the delayed effect of glucocorticoids which generally occurs several hours after administration. The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids are largely due to the inhibition of gene expression which encodes for proinflammatory cytokines in the airway inflammatory cells (Undem and Lichtenstein 2001). Part of the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids may be due to the induction of lipocortin. Lipocortin is a protein which inhibits phospholipase A2. Phospholipase A2 enzymes cause cleavage of arachidonic acid from phospholipids in the plasma membrane. The arachidonic acid is the substrate for the synthesis of leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxane A2, which are important inflammatory mediators. Although glucocorticoids are generally effective in asthma, the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids in COPD patients remains controversial and seems to be very limited (Pauwels et al 1999; Vestbo et al 1999; Burge et al 2000; LHSRG 2000). This seems to reflect a pathophysiological difference between COPD and asthma. It has been suggested, on the basis of in vitro studies, that oxidative stress and cigarette smoke, which both play an important role in the pathophysiology of COPD, induce resistance to the action of glucocorticoids through mechanisms which involve the acetylation of histones. Histones are nucleic proteins that are important regulators in gene expression (Barnes 2000, 2003). Furthermore, the variable effects of glucocorticoids on airway inflammation may be due to the heterogeneity of the disease and the limited reproducibility of markers of inflammation (Keatings et al 1997; Confalonieri et al 1998). What is certain is that glucocorticoids do not modify the natural history of COPD, as measured by the rate of decline in FEV1 (Figure 1). Four large randomized placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials (European Respiratory Society study on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [EUROSCOP], Copenhagen City Lung Study, Inhaled Steroids in Obstructive Lung Disease in Europe [ISOLDE], and Lung Health Study 2 [Pauwels et al 1999; Vestbo et al 1999; Burge et al 2000; LHSRG 2000]) all found that inhaled glucocorticoids had no significant effects on the progressive decline in FEV1 in patients with mild and moderate to severe COPD. One of these studies (Burge et al 2000) in patients with more severe COPD showed a reduction in the frequency of exacerbations (from 1.33 to 0.99 per year, a reduction of 25%). Other clinical trials with both fluticasone and budesonide showed that inhaled glucocorticoids reduce COPD exacerbation rate (Calverley, Pauwels, et al 2003; Jones et al 2003; Szafranski et al 2003), although the mechanism for this effect is currently unknown. However, an earlier study on a smaller sample showed a reduction in severity, but not in the frequency of exacerbations with inhaled glucocorticoids (Paggiaro et al 1998). From these clinical trials it is concluded that inhaled glucocorticoids should only be administered to patients with severe to very severe COPD (post-bronchodilator FEV1 50% of the predicted value) with frequent exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral glucocorticoids (GICOPD 2001). The dose of glucocorticoids required to reduce the frequency of exacerbations in these patients with COPD is not known (MacNee and Calverley 2003).

PMC2707800_21	"Administration of inhaled glucocorticoids for patients with stable COPD must again be carefully considered because of possible side effects. Oropharyngeal candidiasis, due to the local immunosuppressive effect of glucocorticoids, is a common side effect. Oropharyngeal candidiasis is avoidable to a certain extent by using large volume spacers or rinsing the oropharynx with water after drug delivery. Even when delivered locally, such as by aerosolized inhaler, glucocorticoids may be partly absorbed with consequent systemic side effects due to their high lipid solubility. Particularly notable side effects include suppression of endogenous cortisol synthesis by inhibiting the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis, particularly at doses higher than 1500 g/day (Undem and Lichtenstein 2001); the possibility of osteoporosis even at doses of 500 g/day (Undem and Lichtenstein 2001); a slightly increased risk of glaucoma, particularly during long-term treatment at high doses, and of cataract (Undem and Lichtenstein 2001). Glucocorticoids, particularly at high doses, should be inhaled using a large-volume spacer which increases the profound deposition of the drug and reduces drug deposition in the oropharynx, with a consequent reduction in the incidence of candidiasis. However, in the absence of proven efficacy and because of possible side effects, including systemic side effects, and high costs, there is no rational pharmacological basis for the use of inhaled glucocorticoids for all patients with stable COPD, and their use should be limited just to the cases previously described (GICOPD 2001).

Both 2-agonists and long-acting anticholinergics reduce the frequency of exacerbations in COPD (Rennard et al 2001; Casaburi et al 2002) although the mechanism(s) of this effect is currently unknown. Possible anti-inflammatory effects of long-acting 2-agonists (Johnson and Rennard 2001) might explain the reduced frequency of exacerbations of COPD (Mahler et al 1999; Rennard et al 2001; Calverley, Pauwels, et al 2003). These bronchodilators do not seem to cause tachyphylaxis, namely rapid reduction in the intensity of the pharmacological effect due to continued or repeated administration, and are well tolerated. Although bronchodilator treatment in COPD is generally started with a single agent, the use bronchodilators in combination is suggested in the current guidelines as this strategy can result in improved bronchodilator and clinical effect (GICOPD 2001; Celli and McNee 2004). However, the interindividual variability of the bronchodilating effect can be high. The efficacy of combining either short or long-acting 2-agonists with anticholinergics (COMBIVENT 1994; van Noord et al 2000, 2006), anticholinergics and theophylline (Bleecker and Britt 1991; Bellia et al 2002), and all three classes of bronchodilators is known (Nishimura et al 1995).

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines on nebulizer therapy (NPG 1997) recommend that a respiratory physician should evaluate the effectiveness of nebulizer therapy. Before trying chronic nebulizer therapy, it is advisable to evaluate the efficacy of high dose bronchodilator treatment delivered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer. The administration of theophylline for stable COPD remains controversial. Theophylline causes bronchodilation in COPD (Murciano et al 1989; McKay et al 1993) with a variable effect on exercise tolerance and symptoms (Murciano et al 1984; Cooper et al 1987; Chrystyn 1988; Mulloy and McNicholas 1993). Theophylline has a slow onset of action and it is generally recommended for maintenance treatment, rather than for the rapid treatment of symptoms. In the major guidelines for the treatment of COPD, theophylline is considered a third line bronchodilator after inhaled anticholinergics and 2 agonists (Barnes 2006). Nevertheless, theophylline is a useful treatment in patients with severe COPD as its withdrawal leads to significant clinical worsening of the disease (Kirsten DK 1993). The most recent and largely selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 4 isoenzyme, slightly improve lung function in COPD (Compton et al 2001) and reduce the frequency of exacerbations (Edelson et al 2001; Rabe et al 2005; Rennard et al 2006) (see below).

Theophylline may be recommended for patients with persistent symptoms instead of long-acting bronchodilator treatment. However, because of the disadvantages outlined above, administration of theophylline should be continued only if its efficacy on the symptoms has been demonstrated. The role of theophylline in the treatment of COPD is currently being re-evaluated based on important pharmacological evidence which has allowed the molecular mechanism of action of theophylline to be clarified (Barnes 2003).

PMC2707800_26	"Inhaled glucocorticoids are generally prescribed for COPD without demonstration of their effectiveness. However, COPD patients generally have no, or a negligible, response to glucocorticoids (Pauwels et al 1999; Vestbo et al 1999; Burge et al 2000; LHSRG 2000; RS 2003). Some patients may improve after glucocorticoid treatment, but it is likely that these patients have concomitant asthma (Barnes 2000). A two-week trial of oral glucocorticoids was proposed to identify patients with a documented spirometric response, assuming that an acute response is predictive of a chronic response (GISCOPD 2001). However, the oral administration of glucocoticoids for two weeks does not generally allow identification of those patients who will respond to inhaled glucocorticoids (Senderovitz et al 1999; Burge et al 2000, 2003). Therefore, a trial of glucocorticoids is not generally recommended for COPD (GISCOPD 2001), unless required to exclude asthma (Barnes 2000). Glucocorticoids do not reduce airway inflammation in COPD (Barnes 2000) and various long-term studies showed that glucocorticoids are not able to reduce the progression of COPD (Pauwels et al 1999; Vestbo et al 1999; Burge et al 2000; LHSRG 2000). For this reason, and taking into account the risk of systemic side effects, particularly at high doses, glucocorticoids should not generally be administered for COPD (Barnes 2000), though they are recommended for the treatment of exacerbations. Furthermore, inhaled glucocorticoids are recommended for symptomatic COPD patients who have a documented spirometric response to these drugs or for patients with FEV1 50% of the predicted value and frequent exacerbations (two or more per year), which require antibiotics or oral glucocorticoids, according to the GOLD guidelines (GISCOPD 2001). However, these recommendations are not universally agreed (Barnes 2000), as the effect of inhaled glucocorticoids at high doses on the frequency of exacerbations in patients with severe COPD is controversial (Paggiaro et al 1998; Burge et al 2000). Furthermore, the cost of glucocorticoids as well as their pharmacological profile, as discussed above, does not justify indiscriminate administration of inhaled glucocorticoids in COPD. Fixed combinations of inhaled glucocorticoids and long-acting 2-agonists, namely fluticasonesalmeterol (Dransfiel and Bailey 2004) and budesonideformoterol, were approved for use in COPD in the US and other countries based on clinical trials showing their effectiveness for health status and exacerbations of COPD (Calverley, Boonsawat, et al 2003; Calverley, Pauwels, et al 2003; Szafranski et al 2003). However, there were conflicting results when the different combination therapies were compared with the mono-component alone (Nannini et al 2004). More studies to definitively establish the effects of combination therapy in a single inhaler are required, including double-dummy trials on the comparative effects with separate adiministration of the two drugs (Nannini et al 2004).

PDE4 enzymes include at least four isoenzymes (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D) (Soderling and Beavo 2000). Inhibition of PDE4B is mainly responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of PDE4 inhibitors, whereas inhibition of PDE4D causes nausea which is one of the main adverse effects of these drugs (Lipworth 2005). Cilomilast and roflumilast, the two main orally active PDE4 inhibitors, are in the late phase III of clinical development for COPD (Lipworth 2005). Placebo-controlled studies for up to 6 months with cilomilast 15 mg twice daily and roflumilast 500 mg once daily have shown small, although significant, improvements in lung function tests in patients with COPD (Compton et al 2001; Rabe et al 2005). PDE4 inhibitors also reduce the rate of COPD exacerbations compared with placebo (Rabe et al 2005; Rennard et al 2006). The effect of PDE4 inhibitors on health status in patients with COPD is variable possibly due to differences in the duration of treatment (Compton et al 2001; Rabe et al 2005; Rennard et al 2006). Cilomilast at a dose of 15 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces CD4+ T-lymphocyte subsets and CD68+ macrophages in bronchial biopsies from patients with COPD (Gamble et al 2003). However, whether these changes in airway inflammation are related to clinical outcomes in patients with COPD is unknown (Lipworth 2005). The main adverse effects of PDE4 inhibitors are nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain (Lipworth 2005). Roflumilast is more tolerated than cilomilast as it has similar selectivity for PDE4 isoenzymes, whereas cilomilast is 10 times more selective for PDE4D than other isoenzymes (Manning et al 1999; Hatzelmann and Schudt 2001). Long-term studies are required to definitively establish the effects of PDE4 inhibitors on clinical outcomes, including lung function, exacerbation rate, and health status in patients with COPD.

Exacerbations of COPD worsen general health status (Seemungal et al 1998) and are considerably expensive. The number of exacerbations is related to disease severity. Patients with moderate to severe COPD have one or two exacerbations per year (Seemungal et al 1998; Burge et al 2000). Many factors determine the type of treatment used and where the treatment is carried out, for example, in an outpatient or hospital setting.

PMC2707800_33	"The severity of the exacerbations is related to the severity of the disease. In patients with mild COPD, exacerbations are associated with increased breathlessness accompanied by cough and sputum production. They may often be managed out of hospital. Exacerbations of severe COPD are often associated with respiratory failure which may be fatal and require hospital admission on a general ward or intensive care unit. Exacerbations are caused by bacterial or viral infections in around 50% of cases (Monso et al 1995; Soler et al 1998; Seemungal et al 2000). Other factors such as air pollution and temperature may cause exacerbations (MacNee 2002). However, it is not possible to identify a cause in about one third of exacerbations of COPD (Connors et al 1996). One of the main problems is the decision to treat exacerbations of COPD at home or in hospital. This decision is influenced by the severity of symptoms, the severity of COPD, and whether hospital admission is required. Recent trials have shown that about 30% of patients admitted to hospital with exacerbations of COPD could be adequately treated at home with immediate or early discharge and nurse-led home care (Skwarska et al 2000; Cotton et al 2000; Davies et al 1999, 2000). Patients prefer this form of treatment, which has been widely adapted to facilitate the discharge of those patients initially requiring hospitalization (Cotton et al 2000; Ojoo et al 2002). However, a clinical trial showed that home care did not improve the health of the patients whilst increasing costs compared with admission to hospital (Shepperd, Harwood, Gray, et al 1998; Shepperd, Harwood, Jenkinson, et al 1998).

The dose and/or frequency of bronchodilator delivery must be increased or bronchodilator treatment must be started if these drugs have not been used previously. Administration of high doses of antimuscarinics on demand delivered for a number of days using a nebulizer may be useful, even though chronic nebulizer treatment is not generally recommended after an exacerbation (GICOPD 2001). Systemic glucocorticoids are effective for exacerbations of COPD as they facilitate clinical improvement and lung function (Thompson et al 1996; Niewoehner et al 1999; Cotton et al 2000) and are recommended for patients with moderate to severe exacerbations of COPD when the baseline FEV1is less than 50% of the predicted value (GICOPD 2001). The optimum dose and duration of treatment is not known, but administration of oral prednisolone at 40mg per day for ten days is generally effective (GICOPD 2001). Nebulized budesonide is as effective as oral glucocorticoids in improving lung function. However, it is not clear whether the increased costs of inhaled glucocorticoids are justified in all cases (Maltais et al 2002). Antibiotic treatment, which does not generally require parenteral administration, is recommended if two or more of the following symptoms are present: increasing dyspnoea, increasing sputum purulence, or increasing sputum volume (Anthonisen et al 1987). Antibiotics should be chosen which are effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. These are the bacteria that most frequently cause exacerbations of COPD. However, the choice of antibiotics must be based on the antibiogram (GICOPD 2001).

PMC2707800_9	"Bronchodilators are currently the mainstay of the treatment of COPD (GICOPD 2001). Bronchodilators are selective short-acting 2-agonists such as salbutamol, metaproterenol, terbutaline, bambuterol, pirbuterol, isoetharine, bitolterol and fenoterol or selective long-acting 2-agonists such as salmeterol and formoterol; anticholinergic antimuscarinic agents such as ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide and tiotropium bromide, and methylxanthines such as theophylline. Short- and long-acting 2-agonists and antimuscarinic agents are generally administered by inhalation (aerosol, dry-powder or nebuliser solution). Bronchodilator therapy is most frequently delivered by pressurized metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) or dry-powder inhalers (DPIs). Because of the lower bioavailability in asthma patients, the dose delivered by DPIs should be doubled compared with that of MDIs (RS 2003); while a study comparing ipratropium bromide delivered by MDIs and by DPIs in COPD patients found that there was no difference between these two types of inhalers (Cuvelier et al 2002). The use of a spacer device to improve drug delivery proves particularly useful for patients who have poor inhalation technique. In a study on patients with COPD, inhalation of salbutamol through MDIs with spacer and dry-powder inhalers produced similar bronchodilating effects (Ikeda et al 1999). However, further studies are necessary to establish deposition in the respiratory tract and the dose-effect relationship of drugs delivered by different inhalers in patients with COPD, as these are important factors in the choice of dosage. Short-acting 2-agonists such as salbutamol and terbutaline are also available for oral or parenteral delivery. Theophylline is generally administered orally, mostly frequently in controlled release preparations which prolong the pharmacological effect of the drug, even if they do not significantly eliminate the interindividual variability of the bioavailability. For chronic administration, bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment of COPD as they prevent and improve symptoms (Chrystyn et al 1988; Vathenen et al 1988; Gross et al 1989; Rennard 2004). One of the main therapeutic effects of bronchodilators, at least in severe COPD, is improvement in the emptying of the lungs during expiration. This causes a reduction in dynamic hyperinflation at rest and during exercise with consequent improvement in exercise tolerance (Belman et al 1996). However, it is not easy to predict the extent of this improvement based on an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) after a short period of bronchodilatory therapy (Berger and Smith 1988; Hay et al 1992). The evaluation of the efficacy of bronchodilators is generally based on questionnaires concerning symptom variation. COPD may require inhalation of a short-acting 2-agonist on demand or, when airways obstruction is more severe, chronic administration of an antimuscarinic agent by inhalation or a long-acting 2-agonist (RS 2003).

PMC2707802_0	"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined as a disease state characterized by poorly reversible airflow limitation and loss of pulmonary capillary bed. It is usually progressive and associated with abnormal inflammatory responses in the lung (Pauwels et al 2001). Chronic inflammation is a predominant feature of COPD and involves the airways (Saetta et al 2001), lung parenchyma (Saetta et al 1999), and pulmonary vasculature (Peinado et al 1999). It is caused by exposure to inhaled noxious particles and gases present in tobacco smoke (Von Essen et al 1995; Salvi et al 1999) and likely in other air pollutants that may be inhaled during breathing. Macrophages, T lymphocytes (predominately CD8+), and neutrophils are increased numerically as well as activated (Pesci et al 1998), this results in the release of a variety of mediators (Keatings et al 1996; Mueller et al 1996; Yamamoto et al 1997; Beeh et al 2003) that are believed to be capable of unbalance the protease-antiprotease equilibrium (Gottlieb et al 1996; Stockley et al 1999) and damage lung structures (Liu et al 1999; Shapiro and Senior 1999).

PMC2707802_1	"The pathological hallmarks of COPD are inflammation of the peripheral airways and destruction of lung parenchyma or emphysema (Thurlbeck 1991). The functional consequence of these abnormalities is expiratory airflow limitation. Since the determinants of expiratory flow through the airways are both the driving alveolar pressure that promotes flow (elastic recoil of the lung) and the opposing resistance of the airways, the reduction in flow occurring in COPD is defined more accurately as airflow limitation rather than airflow obstruction, since both loss of elastic recoil and increase in airway resistance play an important role (Pride and Green 1997). Emphysema will contribute to the airflow limitation by reducing the elastic recoil of the lung through parenchymal destruction, as well as by reducing the elastic load applied to the airways through destruction of alveolar attachments. On the other hand, inflammation of the peripheral airways will contribute to the airflow limitation by increasing the thickness of the airway wall which, together with fibrosis and smooth muscle hypertrophy, may cause airway narrowing (Thurlbeck 1985). The role of mucus hypersecretion in the development of chronic airflow limitation is still controversial (Peto et al 1983; Vestbo et al 1996).

PMC2707802_10	"Dyspnea is believed to be the unpleasant awareness of the respiratory muscle effort. As it was discussed above DH both increases the pressure changes needed to achieve a given tidal volume and decreases the ability of the respiratory muscles to generate this pressure (Marshall 1962; Kim et al 1976; Similowski et al 1991; Polkey et al 1998). This then increases the amount of pressure needed to achieve a certain tidal volume with respect to the maximum pressure (Killian et al 1992). The change in lung mechanics during exacerbation of COPD has been show to be directly related to dyspnea during spontaneously breathing. The improvement in operating lung volumes (ie, increase in inspiratory capacity [IC]) as the exacerbation resolves is correlated to symptomatic improvement and reductions in dyspnea (Parker et al 2005; Stevenson et al 2005). While COPD patients do not usually stop exercise at higher rates of perceived dyspnea than normal subjects, the ratio of symptoms to the metabolic load and minute ventilation are usually increased (Killian and Jones 1994; Hamilton et al 1996). In these patients there exists a close correlation between breathlessness during exercise and DH (ODonnell et al 1993; Eltayara et al 1996; Puente-Maestu et al 2005; Vogiatzis et al 2005).

Generally, high-intensity training is argued to be needed for the improvement of exercise capacity (Casaburi et al 2001). Although patients with moderately severe COPD (mean forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] >45% predicted) can tolerate high levels (80%) of their peak tolerance for several minutes (Neder et al 2000), more severe disease (FEV1 <45% predicted) are unable to tolerate such high exercise intensities for long periods of time (Maltais et al 1997). Together with peripheral muscle dysfunction, the major factor that limit exercise tolerance in these patients is the development of DH, and the concurrent mechanical constraints on ventilation that contribute importantly to perceived respiratory discomfort (Diaz et al 2000; Puente-Maestu et al 2005). Dynamic hyperventilation is evident even with short exercise bouts in interval training (Vogiatzis et al 2004). In one study, a correlation was found between resting hyperinflation (measured as RV/TLC%) and the increase in endurance time after 8 weeks of leg muscle rehabilitation (Puente-Maestu et al 2003).

In another controlled study, the same effect was seen after 8 weeks of leg training on a bike compared with no training in moderate to severe COPD (Puente-Maestu et al 2006). In another study the opposite was observed (Pellegrino 1999). However, this latter study included eight quite unusual COPD subjects (ie, 38 [11] years, FEV1 3.5 (0.5) L and V O2 2.86 (0.6) L min1) that can not be regarded as a typical population of COPD patients.

Recent developments have revitalized the interest on this crucial psychopathological consequence of obstructive disease. In accordance with this renewed interest, a provocative hypothesis has been put forward recently that proposes that the transition from peripheral airways disease to COPD follows three pathophysiological stages defined by the severity of expiratory flow limitation: In Stage I, closing volume eventually exceeds the functional residual capacity (FRC); in Stage II tidal volume expiratory flow limitation (EFL) develops; and in Stage III, DH increases to a point that produces dyspnea and exercise limitation. The presence of airway closure (Stage I) and EFL (Stage II) may promote peripheral airway injury and accelerate the abnormalities of lung function (Milic-Emili 2004).

Endurance time increased with supplemental oxygen at several different inhaled concentrations of oxygen both in a small group (10) of severe mildly hypoxemic COPD patients and 7 healthy controls. In both groups oxygen reduced fR, dyspnea, and increased VT, and endurance time in a dose-dependent fashion, but the effects were relatively larger in the COPD patients. In the healthy subjects, differences were only appreciable with FIO2 > 0.5 or more. The improvement in endurance time was correlated with a decrease in EELV (Somfay et al 2001). In a group of 18 severe COPD patients, oxygen reduced the degree of DH during recovery from exercise but did not reduce breathlessness compared with air, which suggests that lung mechanics may play a different role in the genesis of dyspnea during recovery from exercise (Stevenson et al 2004).

One study reported a decrease in fR for a given work-rate, and increases in VT and ventilation were found (Light et al 1996). The reported side-effects of opioids and their tendency to lead to tolerance and addiction preclude their use except in highly specific cases and end-of-life situations. Benzodiazepines do not seem to improve exercise capacity or dyspnea (Haas et al 1993) and have a deleterious effect on inspiratory muscle function, reducing both VT and minute ventilation (Jolly et al 1996).

Earlier negative studies may have included subjects whose exercise capacity was not ventilatory-limited. In fact, several studies in Table 2 demonstrate that the effects of bronchodilators are larger in those with flow limitation than in those without flow limitation. Flow limitations are a major determinant of exercise capacity (Diaz et al 2000). Alternatively, they may have included a great proportion of patients that were not responsive to bronchodilators (about 1/3 of COPD patients do not improve either FEV1 or IC with bronchodilators) (Newton et al 2002). Third, some of those studies may have used insufficient doses and only a few included long-acting bronchodilators, and in particular, none included tiotropium (Liesker et al 2002). Fourth, most studies included 6 minute walking tests to measure exercise capacity; however, 6 minute walking distance is sensitive to a learning effect. Two training sessions are necessary to eliminate a learning effect in walking tests (Kervio et al 2003; Knox et al 1988). Constant work load tests appears to be more appropriate than other tests, as they allow for placebo-controlled comparisons of symptoms and physiological parameters, including exercise endurance time at a standardized work rate or power output (ODonnell, Fluge, et al 2004). Cycle exercise endurance testing, combined with measurements of exertional dyspnea, ventilation, and dynamic operating lung volumes, has been shown to be reliable, reproducible, and responsive to the intervention (Oga et al 2000; Puente-Maestu et al 2003; ODonnell, Fluge, et al 2004).

A systematic analysis pooled results from seven trials enrolling nearly 400 patients and found no significant improvement in recovery of pulmonary function in patients with acute asthma who were treated with heliox (Rodrigo et al 2001, 2003). One study examined the effects of heliox (80:20) on gas exchange, breathing pattern, respiratory mechanics, and gas distribution in patients with stable, but severe, COPD (Swidwa et al 1985). Heliox was not associated with significant changes in minute ventilation or breathing pattern, however a 15% reduction in FRC which increased back to baseline after a return to air breathing was observed. On the other hand another small trial found no change in DH among COPD patients (Pecchiari et al 2004). In addition, the high cost and limited availability of heliox make its clinical use more difficult. In another study, researchers used an esophageal balloon in recently extubated patients without significant lung disease to quantify intrathoracic pressure swings and estimate the work of breathing (Jaber et al 2001). Fifteen of 18 patients exhibited a drop in their work of breathing, although gas exchange parameters were unchanged. The patients also reported decreased dyspnea while breathing heliox.

PMC2707802_3	"The respiratory system (ie, the combined elastic recoil of the lung and chest wall) is an elastic structure able to change its shape and volume in order to breathe the necessary air in, and the alveolar gas out, to sustain the amount of gas exchange needed to match metabolic needs. Under normal physiological conditions the respiratory muscles provide the power to produce such changes in volume. For a given change in pleural pressure generated by the respiratory muscles, the attainable end-inspiratory and end-expiratory volumes are determined by the passive pressurevolume (PV) relationship of the respiratory system (Figure 1) (Mead et al 1967; Agostoni and Hyatt 1986). The PV behavior of the respiratory system is distinctly sigmoid (Figure 1) since the respiratory system is most compliant between 20% to 80% of the vital capacity (VC) (Mead et al 1967; Agostoni and Hyatt 1986). To state this in a clearer way, the elastic work of breathing is minimized by maintaining tidal volume within the 20%80% of the VC range. In COPD there are different forms and degrees of damage to the alveolar wall resulting in pathophysiological changes in the lung elastic recoil. These changes might reduce the amount of pressure required to achieve a specific change in volume (Cherniack et al 1963; Saksena and Burrows 1966), or simply shift the normal relationship upwards near passive FRC (Figure 1) (Sharp et al 1968). There is limited information about passive elastic recoil characteristics of the lung and chest wall during exercise, but at least in healthy subjects, they remain essentially unchanged, or decrease slightly (Stubbing et al 1980; Younes and Kivinen 1984). Therefore total lung capacity (TLC) does not change significantly during physical activity either in normal subjects or in COPD patients (Stubbing et al 1980).

Stem cells may indeed improve the compliance characteristics of the lung. However, at this time lung volume-reduction surgery (LVRS; a surgical or bronchoscopic procedure that involves resection or exclusion of the most severely affected regions of diseased lung tissue) in patients with diffuse emphysema, may improve lung function by increasing elastic recoil of the lung, the effective pressure driving maximal expiratory flow airway, and the conductance of the airways by augmenting the radial traction of their alveolar attachments. Hence it may improve flow proportionately at all areas of the lung and secondarily reduce hyperinflation (Brantigan et al 1959; Rogers et al 1968; Fessler and Permutt 1998; Ingenito et al 2001). This surgery was initially described in the late 1950s (Brantigan et al 1959). The persistent air leaks that limited early success have been diminished considerably by the recent surgical advances, which has increased interest in this procedure and led to its greater availability (Wakabayashi et al 1991; Cooper et al 1995; Keenan et al 1996; Hazelrigg et al 1997; Brenner et al 2004).

The most common indication for bullectomy is severe dyspnea in the setting of a large bulla occupying at least 30%50% of the hemithorax. Another indication is history of a pneumothorax. The physiologic outcome after surgery is determined largely by the size of the bulla and the severity of the underlying emphysema, and patients with severe generalized emphysema tend to do poorly (Nickoladze 1992). The surgical risk is increased when the FEV1 is less than 40% of predicted, and the presence of severe dyspnea, a markedly reduced FEV1, hypercapnia, or cor pulmonale makes the risk of surgery almost prohibitive (Gunstensen and McCormack 1973).

PMC2707802_36	"Intrinsic PEEP is frequent in mechanically ventilated patients with obstructive airways disease. Several studies indicate that in patients with flow limitation by dynamic airway collapse, the application of small amounts of external PEEP can be beneficial since intrinsic PEEP can account for about one-third of the total work of breathing (Coussa et al 1993). Hyperinflation may not be affected when applied PEEP is below 85% of the measured auto-PEEP (Ranieri et al 1993), however not all patients with auto-PEEP and DH have expiratory flow limitation (Armaganidis et al 2000) and care has to be taken to reduce the impact of a narrow diameter or kinked endotracheal tube, inspisated secretions, exhalation/PEEP valves, and asynchrony due to pain or agitation. The incidence of expiratory flow limitation has been reported to be as high as 93% upon initiation of mechanical ventilation, but it is reduced by half over time with therapy (Alvisi et al 2003). It seems to be more likely when patients are supine instead of semirecumbent (Valta et al 1994).

PMC2707802_37	"A recent meta-analysis of 7 studies including a total of 65 patients with COPD shows a modest beneficial effect of ventilatory support on exercise tolerance as well (van t Hul et al 2002), probably in part because continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) unloads inspiratory muscles from the inspiratory threshold load imposed by intrinsic PEEP (Pepe and Marini 1982; Haluszka et al 1990; Petrof et al 1990; Lougheed et al 1995). In severe COPD patients CPAP of 0.5kPa resulted in a significant reduction in dyspnea and an increase in exercise endurance time (ODonnell, Sanii, Giesbrecht, et al 1988; ODonnell, Sanii, Younes, et al 1988), however excessive CPAP increases the perception of breathing effort (ODonnell, Sanii, Giesbrecht, et al 1988) and hence it should be titrated individually. Inspiratory pressure support (IPS) a form of pressure-targeted mechanical ventilation which each breath is patient triggered and supported has been shown to improve exercise tolerance (Keilty et al 1994; Maltais et al 1995; Kyroussis et al 2000; Polkey et al 2000; vant Hul et al 2004) and reduce lactate production (Polkey et al 2000). Proportional assisted ventilation, a mode of partial ventilatory assistance adapted to the intensity and timing of spontaneous ventilatory pattern by providing inspiratory pressure in proportion to a patients spontaneous effort, has been shown also to increase exercise tolerance (Dolmage and Goldstein 1997; Bianchi et al 1998). The role of pressure support in severely limited COPD patients is not yet clear. In a recent double-blind controlled study of 29 patients with moderate-severe COPD and ventilatory limitation during an incremental exercise test, 37 patients were exercised with either IPS 1kPa (19 subjects) versus 0.5kPa (18 subjects) in the control group. Statistically significant differences were found in favor of the IPS in shuttle walking distance, cycle endurance, and reduction in minute ventilation during exercise (vant Hul et al 2004).

PMC2707802_41	"Since TLC remains essentially unaltered during exercise (Stubbing et al 1980; Younes and Kivinen 1984) changes in EELV during exercise can be reliably tracked by serial IC measurements (Figure 5). Exercise IC measurements are reproducible, provided care is taken with their measurement. In one study of 29 patients the variability coefficient was 17% at rest and approximately 20% during exercise with intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.77 and 0.73 respectively (ODonnell et al 1998). In another study of 15 patient esophageal pressures were found reproducible during IC maneuvers during exercise at different work-rates, the reduction in IC during exercise correlates well with esophageal balloon-derived measurements of dynamic compliance (ODonnell, Chau, et al 1997). In another study, three methods of measuring IC were tested in 10 severe COPD subjects. IC calculated, after correction of the expiratory part of the signal, as the difference between the mean EELV of the six breaths that preceded the IC prompt and the peak inspiratory volume was found to be the most reproducible method (Dolmage and Goldstein 2002). In an unpublished multicentric study of 463 patients with moderate to severe COPD, the intra-class correlation of exercise IC measurements during serial exercise tests exceeded 0.85 (ODonnell, He, et al 2004). The extent of the reduction in IC with exercise in COPD is variable. In a population of 105 patients with moderate to severe COPD, IC at end-exercise was reduced by 20% of its already-reduced resting value (ODonell et al 2001). In another smaller group of 27 severe COPD patients a similar reduction was found at maximum ventilation at the end of high intensity exercise (Puente-Maestu et al 2005). Similar changes were found in severe COPD in 15 severe COPD (Yan et al 1997). However, guidelines for standardization of IC measurement have not yet been issued. Recently a new complex method called optoelectronic plethysmography has been developed for research purposes (Aliverti et al 2004)

PMC2707802_5	"where P is the pressure applied, C the compliance of the system, tx the time elapsed, and R the resistance. The product RC is the time constant, which determines the speed of the change), as can be seen in Figure 2. During inspiration, even when inspiratory resistances are high, flow down the airways can be increased by increasing the force of inspiratory muscle contraction up to its maximum capacity (Younes and Riddle 1981). The same is true during expiration at relative low pressures, but during forced expiration in both normal and COPD, increments in alveolar pressure (generated by increasing muscle effort) produce progressively smaller increments in expiratory flow, until flow ultimately reaches a plateau (Figure 3) where it is independent of any increase of driving pressure (Hyatt and Wilcox 1963). This phenomenon is called flow limitation and it seems to be related to the dynamic compression of the intra-thoracic airways at a segment progressively distal as lung volume decreases (Green and Pride 1997). The resulting increase in airways resistance offsets the pressure generated by the additional increase in muscular effort, and therefore expiratory flow is actually largely independent of muscle effort and is determined by the respiratory system elastic recoil. Elastic recoil of the system is proportional to lung volume and the expiratory airways conductance (ie, the inverse of resistance) (Hyatt 1983). Respiratory mechanics in COPD are characterized by both elevated inspiratory and expiratory resistance to airflow (McGregor and Becklake 1961; Citterio 1981; Aldrich et al 1989). An increased inspiratory airflow resistance can be compensated by augmenting the activation of the inspiratory muscles (Im Hof et al 1986), but the increased expiratory resistance, together with the reduced lung elastic recoil present in these patients, further limits expiratory flow (Hyatt 1961). This is physiologically much more deleterious because expiration is primarily effort independent (Figure 3), and cannot be compensated by increasing expiratory muscle effort (Poon et al 1987). The consequence in COPD is that the time needed for lung units to empty their volume and achieve their passive equilibrium point is significantly increased and many of them do not reach their relaxation volume before a new inspiration is initiated. As a result, part of the gas that would have been expired in a normal lung remains trapped (ie, more gas remains inside that what would be if those units were not altered) and the alveolar pressure at the end of the expiration is higher than the atmospheric pressure (intrinsic PEEP) (Pride and Macklem 1986; Younes 1991). In young healthy subjects RV is about 25% of the TLC, and FRC is about 50% of the TLC (Stocks and Quanjer 1995). In older healthy subjects, RV and FRC are about 30% and 55% of TLC respectively (Stocks and Quanjer 1995). In COPD, values of RV and FRC are increased to values as high as 70% and 85% of the TLC, respectively (Fishman et al 2003). Since tidal breathing is performed at FRC, COPD must breathe at volumes that are very close to TLC where the system is much less distensible (Figure 1).
"	HP_0006510
PMC2707802_6	"During exercise minute ventilation must increase to meet the increased metabolic demands. This is achieved by increasing both the tidal volume (VT) and the respiratory frequency (fR), what means that the expiratory time necessary to reach passive FRC or below is reduced. In normal young subjects expiratory flow is fast enough to decrease end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) up to 0.51L below the resting FRC with increasing work. This is due to the activation of expiratory muscles (Pride and Macklem 1986; Henke et al 1988). The decreased EELV not only allows increasing VT within the most compliant part of the PV relationship, but also has a beneficial inspiratory effect because, as the expiratory muscles relax, the passive tendency of the respiratory system below FRC is towards inspiration. In older subjects, EELV also decreases during moderate exercise, but thereafter, tends to increase back to near resting levels (Johnson et al 1991). In COPD, due to the increased flow limitation, more and more units are unable to empty their gas as expiratory time decreases when the respiratory rate increases, and EELV typically rises (Figures 1 and 4) (Hyatt 1961; Grimby et al 1968; Potter et al 1971; Dodd et al 1984; Pride and Macklem 1986; Babb et al 1991; Younes 1991; Yan et al 1997; Diaz et al 2000; ODonell et al 2001; Oga et al 2002, 2003; ODonnell and Webb 2003; Puente-Maestu et al 2005) in spite of expiratory muscles activity (Dodd et al 1984; Younes 1991). This temporary increase in EELV in COPD above its baseline (admittedly already elevated) value is termed DH. The extent of DH depends on the degree of expiratory flow limitation, the prevailing ventilation, the breathing pattern for a given ventilation, and is inversely related to the level of resting lung hyperinflation (ODonnell et al 2001; Puente-Maestu et al 2005).
"	HP_0006510
PMC2707802_7	"To move the air into the alveoli, sufficient force must be exerted by the respiratory muscles to expand the lungs and the chest wall. In addition, respiratory muscles must overcome the resistance and inertia in the system so that air will flow into the airways. This force is provided by the respiratory muscles and, thus, breathing is the results of their cyclic activation. Whether the net force is inspiratory or expiratory will depend on the balance between the pressure generated by the muscles and the elastic recoil of the respiratory system. The maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures that the respiratory muscles are able to generate are related to several factors such as age (Black and Hyatt 1969), muscle training (Leith and Bradley 1976), the integrity of the inervation (Gross et al 1980) and, more important for the present discussion, of the length and shape (usually termed as configuration) of the respiratory muscles, and particularly of the diaphragm (Marshall 1962). According to the Laplaces relationship (the Laplace relationship establishes the relationship between the pressure generated across a curved surface P, the tension of the surface T and its radius r: P=T/r), the less curved a surface is, the lower the pressure difference created across it. Thus at high lung volumes, a given neural output would be likely to cause less change in trans-diaphragmatic pressure than at low lung volumes. Furthermore, inspiratory muscles are able to generate less pressure for a given neural input because of their lengthtension relationship (Kim et al 1976; Similowski et al 1991; Polkey et al 1998). The ability of the respiratory muscles to sustain a given level of pressure output (endurance) is defined by its pressure time index (PTI) (McGregor and Becklake 1961; Bellee and Grassino 1982, 1983)
"	
PMC2707802_8	"Where Pimus is the inspiratory muscular pressure needed to achieve a certain displacement of the respiratory system, MIP is the maximum inspiratory pressure, Ti the inspiratory time and Ttot the total respiratory time. Thus the PTI is determined to a considerable degree by how high MIP is, and the fraction of MIP required to sustaining a given VT. MIP decreases as lung volume increases, while maximum expiratory pressure changes in the opposite direction (Agostoni and Hyatt 1986), therefore at high volumes a greater fraction of maximum effort is required to generate the same pressure. Paradoxically, thus, while flow limitation is primarily an expiratory phenomenon, its consequences are mainly suffered by the inspiratory muscles because expiratory muscles cannot appreciably increase flow (Figures 3) (Hyatt 1961, 1983; Hyatt and Wilcox 1963; Pride and Macklem 1986; Green and Pride 1997) to force the emptying of the lungs. In consequence the volume at which the respiratory system has to operate is increased (Hyatt 1961; Grimby et al 1968; Potter et al 1971; Dodd et al 1984; Pride and Macklem 1986; Babb et al 1991; Younes 1991; Yan et al 1997; Diaz et al 2000; ODonnell et al 2001; Oga et al 2002, 2003; ODonnell and Webb 2003; Puente-Maestu et al 2005) and hence the elastic work needed for a given displacement of the thorax (Figure 1 and 4) (Cherniack et al 1963; Saksena and Burrows 1966; Mead et al 1967; Sharp et al 1968; Younes and Kivinen 1984; Agostoni and Hyatt 1986). Second inspiratory muscles have to generate a substantial inspiratory pressure (intrinsic PEEP) before inspiratory airflow can occur. PEEP behaves actually as an inspiratory threshold load (Pepe and Marini 1982; Pride and Macklem 1986; Haluszka et al 1990; Younes 1991), and finally, as we have seen above, at high lung volume efficacy of respiratory muscles as pressure generators is greatly reduced (Marshall 1962; Kim et al 1976; Similowski et al 1991; Polkey et al 1998).

PMC2707802_9	"Patients with COPD characteristically show a poor exercise performance which is manifested as marked reduction in peak oxygen uptake and decreased endurance to submaximal levels of exercise (Table 1) (Gallagher 1994; Casaburi et al 1999; ODonnell and Webb 2003). The origin of this poor exercise tolerance is multifactorial and includes abnormal lung mechanics, impaired pulmonary gas exchange, destruction of the pulmonary vascular bed, impaired cardiac function and peripheral muscle dysfunction (Gallagher 1994; Casaburi et al 1999; ODonnell and Webb 2003). Dynamic hyperinflation has a detrimental impact on exercise tolerance via three important physiopathological mechanisms. The relatively rapid shallow breathing pattern in COPD compared with healthy subjects, reflects the mechanical constraints on tidal volume expansion, which has an exaggerated frequency-dependency in COPD, fR increases with exercise in COPD up to a maximum of about 2535min1 (Diaz et al 2000; Nield et al 2003; Puente-Maestu et al 2005). At increased respiratory rates, the inversely proportional decrease in expiratory time, even though there is a slight reduction of Ti/Ttot to 0.400.45 (Diaz et al 2000; Puente-Maestu et al 2005), and as result of the decreased expiratory time further DH ensues. When EELV reaches approximately 0.5L tidal volume, ventilation reaches a plateau (or even a slight decreases), exercise soon stops (Figure 5) (ODonnell et al 2001; Puente-Maestu et al 2005). This encroachment of tidal volume not only hampers the ventilatory response to the metabolic load of exercise, it contributes to reducing the efficiency of ventilation (ie, increases the dead space) as well (Gallagher 1994).

Pulmonary artery pressure approximately equals to right ventricular systolic pressure in the absence of pulmonary artery outflow obstruction or stenosis. The right ventricular pressure (RVP) is approximated by the modified Bernoulli equation as 4v2, in which v is the velocity of the tricuspid jet in meters per second.

Estimation of PAP was possible in 44% of patients with advanced lung disease similar to the previous study.41 Doppler ECHO-estimated systolic PAP was accurate (within 10 mm Hg of RHC measurement) in only 48% of patients. However, the accuracy of Doppler ECHO was higher in patients with obstructive lung disease than in ILD or pulmonary vascular disease. The likelihood of estimating systolic PAP was lower in patients with marked air trapping define as residual volume >150% (40% versus 56%; P = 0.007).42 In a study by Himelman and colleagues, the detection rate of TR jet could be improved from 56% to 92% (P < 0.001) by the use of agitated saline contrast.43 These studies show low sensitivity of ECHO in estimating PAP in COPD patients and agitated saline contrast may improve the detection rate.

The caveat in these studies is the low BNP value and hence poor specificity due to potential overlap with normal subjects. Large studies need to be conducted to validate these findings. The use of BNP can identify patients with subclinical PH. Further research needed to understand the clinical implication of identifying pre-clinical PH in COPD.

This hypothesis was tested in an anesthetized open chest dog model and the flow difference measured. There was 8% difference in flow when end-tidal PCO2 was elevated in the presence of hypoxia, compared to hypoxia alone.17 Hypoxia may induce endothelial cells to release proliferate cytokine leading to cellular hypertrophy in the vessel wall and increase in extracellular matrix.

Approximately 20 million Americans are affected, and there is likely a similar worldwide prevalence. COPD is increasingly recognized as a systemic disease with extra-pulmonary manifestations such as skeletal muscle myopathy, osteoporosis, anemia, and depression.13 It is also linked with cardiovascular co-morbidities and various malignancies.4,5 As a result, COPD is associated with major morbidity and mortality. In the United States, COPD is the fourth leading cause of death (behind heart disease, cancer and stroke) accounting for more than 119,000 deaths per year; however, the number of deaths due to COPD is increasing while most others causes decline.6 Furthermore, the prevalence and mortality of COPD has been increasing faster over the last two decades in women compared to men, so that mortality due to COPD is now equal among men and women. Thus, COPD is projected to overtake stroke as the third most common cause of death in the US by 2020. The estimated direct cost of COPD in the US is substantial, and a portion of this money is spent toward medications designed not only to alleviate symptoms, but also ideally to slow disease progression and reduce mortality. By 2012, COPD drug costs are expected to reach almost 6 billion dollars per year in the US, Japan, and part of Western Europe alone.7 This estimate excludes many large and populous areas, such as India and China, where COPD is becoming an increasingly recognized and prevalent condition, both due to smoking and other sources of air pollution.8,9

Airflow obstruction, usually measured using spirometry, is a useful marker of disease since testing is reasonably reproducible and widely available. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung disease (GOLD) has proposed spirometric criteria for diagnosis and severity assessment of COPD using the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the ratio of the FEV1 over the forced vital capacity (FVC) after bronchodilator.10 When incorporated with other clinical information, spirometry can also be used to predict survival in COPD.11 Progression of airflow obstruction, another hallmark of COPD, can also be determined by serial spirometry measurements over time. Sustained improvements in spirometry, or at least a reduction in the rate of FEV1 decline, should reflect reduced morbidity and mortality.

The loss of elastic recoil promotes airway collapse during exhalation.
"	
PMC2898088_11	"The abnormal inflammatory response that causes these patterns of injury has yet to be fully characterized, and there are likely multiple pathways that lead to impaired lung function. Three major proposed mechanisms are: activation of elastolytic proteases, chronic oxidative stress, and accelerated aging.4244 Cigarette smoking provides the initial stimulus which recruits cells into the lung parenchyma. Circulating monocytes become macrophages in the lung and subsequently recruit additional macrophages, neutrophils, and activated T-lymphocytes. The level of inflammation in COPD lungs is greater than that seen in the lungs of smokers without COPD, and the number of neutrophils in sputum is predictive of lung function decline.45 Unlike asthma, the inflammation with COPD is generally resistant to the effects of corticosteroids, and these pathological changes are progressive. Once activated, the recruited cells release enzymes such as neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) which destroy normal lung tissue. One of the hallmarks of COPD is this imbalance between proteases, which are part of the normal host defense to bacteria or foreign bodies, and inactivating anti-proteases;46 the subset of patients with genetic deficits in alpha-1 antitrypsin, a protease inhibitor, are a good example of this principle. One other clinical observation that suggests protease/anti-protease imbalance is the loss of skin elasticity and wrinkling that also occurs in and correlates with severity of emphysema; this also illustrates the extra-pulmonary effects of COPD, although such changes could also be the direct result of smoking.47 Oxidative stress may also play a role, either as a result of oxidants present in cigarette smoke or the generation and release of reactive oxygen species from leukocytes. Oxidative stress can increase activity of proteases, and lead to inactivation of anti-proteases. Finally, the changes seen with COPD may be an accelerated version of senile emphysema. As described above, some of the same pathological changes seen with COPD also occur in elderly subjects, such as loss of elastic tissue and distal airspace enlargement. Several in vitro and animal studies support this hypothesis. For example, fibroblasts from those with emphysema have reduced proliferative capacity compared to control smokers,48 which may be related to telomere length. Telomere shortening is accelerated by oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Additionally, the anti-aging molecule sirtuin SIRT1 is also reduced in murine COPD lungs. These and other changes suggest COPD could be a disease of premature aging.49

Whether these findings reflect spill-over of pulmonary inflammation, or a separate activation of a generalized inflammatory response, is unknown.3 Those with COPD have higher circulating levels of cytokines and acute phase reactants than those who smoke but do not have COPD. Interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin-8, and ghrelin are all elevated in COPD, as are C-reactive protein and fibrinogen.3 Although the effects of these substances are wide ranging, they probably modulate some of the systemic effects of COPD. For example, circulating IL-6 has been associated with skeletal muscle atrophy, and TNF- with muscle atrophy and cachexia. These systemic effects could also contribute to decrements in spirometry.

PMC2898088_15	"There are two commonly used classes of bronchodilators: beta-agonists and anti-cholinergics. Beta-agonists stimulate -2 adrenergic receptors, increase levels of cyclic AMP, and thereby inhibit bronchoconstriction. Inhaled forms are preferred because of rapid onset of action and favorable side effect profile compared to the oral form. Short-acting inhaled beta-agonists, such as albuterol, salbutamol and levalbuterol, have a rapid onset of action (within minutes) and a duration of action on the order of 4 to 6 hours. Long-acting compounds such as salmeterol (onset of action up to one hour) and formoterol (onset of action within minutes) have a duration of action of approximately 12 hours without demonstrable tachyphylaxis with regular use.57 Anticholinergics block muscarinic receptors (M1, M2, and M3), blocking the action of acetylcholine on the airway smooth muscle, which leads to airway smooth muscle relaxation. Short-acting anticholinergic preparations (ipratropium, oxytropium) can have effects lasting up to 8 hours following administration, while the long-acting preparation (tiotropium) has effects that last more than 24 hours. Inhaled anticholinergic compounds have very limited systemic absorption.

For example, beta-agonists have effects on multiple components of the respiratory system, including: decreased airway smooth muscle proliferation; decreased neutrophil number, activity and function; and increased ciliary beat frequency.60 Some or all of these changes could help counteract excessive inflammation, restore innate immunity, or prevent airway remodeling. Similarly, the anti-cholinergic tiotropium has been shown to decrease respiratory syncytial virus replication (RSV) in an in vitro model, and decrease lung fibroblast collagen synthesis.61,62 Thus, these commonly used bronchodilators may affect the progression of COPD through pathways unrelated to their direct effects on bronchomotor tone.

At least in moderate to severe COPD, inhaled corticosteroids can decrease the number of exacerbations and improve quality of life.63 Unfortunately, several small to moderate sized trials using inhaled corticosteroids failed to show a consistent effect of these medications on the rate of decline in FEV1.6366 For example, the Lung Health Research Study Group randomized more than 1100 subjects with all stages of COPD to the inhaled corticosteroid triamcinolone for 40 months: no difference was seen in the rate of lung function decline, the studys primary outcome.64 In the ISOLDE trial, 750 patients were randomized to inhaled fluticasone vs placebo for three years. The annual rate of decline in FEV1 was 50 mL/year in the fluticasone group and 59 mL/year in the placebo group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.16).63 A third contemporary trial by Pauwels and colleagues randomized over 1200 patients to budesonide or placebo for 3 years, and again, the rate of decline was not statistically significantly different (P = 0.39) between budesonide (57 mL/year) vs placebo (69 mL/year). A subgroup analysis suggested that the therapy was more effective in those who had less cigarette pack-year exposure. These studies and others have been combined via meta-analyses which reached conflicting conclusions about the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in ameliorating the decline in lung function.67,68 In the positive meta-analysis by Sutherland and colleagues, corticosteroids were found to reduce the rate of FEV1 decline by 7.7 mL per year compared to placebo. These moderate size trials illustrate the difficulty in detecting the difference in the rate of lung function decline between those patients with COPD not on treatment (with a reported FEV1 decline of 50 mL per year) and those patients with COPD on treatment (expected FEV1 decline somewhere between 25 and 50 mL per year). Such small differences in lung function decline per year make it difficult to discern whether treatment with inhaled corticosteroids truly does alter lung function decline. Trials with both longer periods of active treatment and follow-up will be required to better answer this question. In aggregate, the existing data support a relatively small effect of inhaled steroids on FEV1 decline in COPD.

Treatment with either fluticasone or salmeterol was associated with a decline in FEV1 of only 42 mL per year; and the combination of drugs was 39 mL per year (not statistically significantly different from the individual drug components). There are some legitimate critiques of the trial. Specifically, dropouts were not randomly distributed amongst the different treatment arms, introducing potential bias, with significantly more dropout in the placebo arm (18% vs 9% in the combination therapy arm). Although it could be assumed that those who dropped out had a faster rate of lung function decline, Suissa has convincingly shown how this assumption could be false, since the data could be skewed by the phenomenon of regression to the mean.70,71 Nevertheless the TORCH trial provides the first evidence that treatment of COPD can slow the accelerated decline in FEV1. Although there was a significant decrease in the number of exacerbations, even in patients who had no exacerbations during the trial there was a similar difference in the rate of decline between those on placebo (56 mL per year) and those with some form of active treatment (27 to 31 mL per year). Since there was improvement in both the salmeterol and fluticasone groups, but little added improvement in the combination group it suggests that there are multiple potential mechanisms for improvement in lung function.

Tiotropium was compared to placebo with the primary outcome rate of decline in FEV1. Importantly, patients were allowed to continue respiratory medications other than an inhaled anti-cholinergic, and the majority of patients were on a long-acting beta-agonist and/or an inhaled corticosteroid. Again, about 6000 patients were recruited, with 60% completing 45 months of follow-up. The addition of tiotropium did not slow the rate of FEV1 decline compared to placebo. In this trial, the rate of decline was only 38 mL per year in the treatment arm, and 40 mL per year in the placebo arm, only slightly greater than expected due to normal aging. Possible explanations of these data are the relatively low rate of smoking (as compared to other studies), which may have a much greater effect than any medication on the rate of lung function decline, and the high rate of concurrent use of other kinds of COPD medications. In support of this latter hypothesis, there was a difference in the rate of decline in post-bronchodilator FEV1 between tiotropium and placebo in those subjects not on either an inhaled corticosteroid or long-acting beta-agonist (40  3 mL per year in the tiotropium group vs 47  3 mL per year in the placebo group, P = 0.046).

Inhaled corticosteroids have an anti-inflammatory effect, which presumably explains their benefit. In contrast, the mechanism by which bronchodilators slow lung function decline is unknown. When combined, the effects of different classes of medications could be additive. Given the small absolute amount of lung function benefit, any clinically meaningful preservation of lung function would likely require years of daily medication use (as well as very long clinical trials to detect), probably in patients with less severe COPD.

Another anti-oxidant, carbocisteine, was recently reported in the PEACE trial to decrease exacerbations during 1 year of active treatment compared to placebo.82 Carbocisteine also has mucolytic and anti-inflammatory properties, so the exact mechanism of any benefit is unknown.

PDE-4 inhibition can decrease airway inflammation in COPD, as assessed by sputum neutrophil and eosinophil counts.96 In addition, one small trial showed that tissue inflammation was reduced with PDE-4 inhibition, which may suggest a role for these drugs in preventing airway and parenchyma remodeling in COPD.97 Recent trials have shown that in select populations of COPD patients, the PDE-4 inhibitor roflumilast can improve lung function and reduce exacerbations when administered for 12 months.98,99 What role, if any, this class of medications has in prevention of long-term lung function decline has not yet been determined.

Thus, education efforts should focus on several important areas including instruction on proper use of inhaled medications (particularly those supplied via unique delivery systems), early recognition of exacerbations, and avoidance of known precipitants. Patient guides are available from several sources, including www.goldcopd.org and www.internationalcopd.org. At each visit, proper compliance with maintenance medications should be emphasized.

PMC2898088_4	"Consideration of age is necessary given the myriad changes that occur in the respiratory system even with normal aging. With aging, there are changes not only in lung parenchyma but also in chest wall shape and in muscle forces  all of which affect spirometry. While the exact shape and details of the curve describing lung function (as assessed by FEV1) by age has yet to be determined, the general shape is shown in Figure 1. As might be expected, FEV1 rapidly increases during childhood and adolescence, before reaching a plateau in early adulthood.14,15 Interestingly, the peak of lung function appears to occur after maximum height has been achieved, so that the improvements in spirometry are not just due to increased lung size (and thus airway caliber). Lung function remains stable at this plateau (with men having a higher plateau value than women) until approximately age 25 to 30 years, after which FEV1 slowly declines. Although there is some controversy as to whether the decline in FEV1 is linear with age or accelerates with aging,16 some of the most robust data suggest that lung function decreases approximately 20 mL per year during middle age, and then decreases more rapidly by about 38 mL per year after age 65.17,18
"	
PMC2898088_5	"Regardless of the exact rate of decline in FEV1 with age, the decline is likely due to a combination of age-related changes of the parenchyma, the chest wall, and the respiratory muscles, which may be difficult to separate using spirometry alone. The chest wall may change with aging due to reduced height of thoracic vertebrae, or stiffening or calcification of the costal joints of the rib cage. Direct measurements have confirmed decreased compliance of the chest wall with aging.19,20 Respiratory muscle function also changes with age. Studies of diaphragm strength have shown a 13% to 25% drop in the maximal inspiratory force generated with aging.21,22 In general, skeletal muscle function, which predicts maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure (MIP and MEP), also decreases with age.23,24 Taken together, these changes may limit the maximal inspiratory and expiratory effort that contribute to FEV1. Perhaps most important in explaining the age-related decline are changes in the lung parenchyma. Pathological studies have shown that beyond age 50 years, elastic fibers at the level of the respiratory bronchiole and alveolus degenerate, or rupture and appear coiled  although the total number of alveolar connections remains unchanged (in contrast to emphysema induced by cigarette smoking).25,26 The abnormal and presumably weakened connections lead to uniform airspace dilatation, a condition that Verbeken and colleagues called senile emphysema. The functional result of these parenchymal lung changes are a decrease in the elastic recoil pressure of the lung and a weakening of the supporting structures of the small airways, which more easily close, even during tidal breathing.2729 All of these changes contribute to the gradual decline in FEV1 with increasing age.

According to guidelines, pharmacotherapy in mild COPD (FEV1/FVC < 0.70 and FEV1  80% of predicted value) focuses on short-acting bronchodilators to relieve symptoms, including short-acting 2-agonists (eg, albuterol) and short-acting anticholinergics (eg, ipratropium bromide, oxitropium); the latter have a longer duration of effect (6 to 9 hours) than short-acting 2-agonists (4 to 6 hours).1,2 When symptoms are persistent, the addition of one or more long-acting bronchodilators is recommended (FEV1/FVC < 0.70, FEV1 < 80% predicted). Recommended agents include LABAs (eg, formoterol, salmeterol), long-acting anticholinergics (eg, tiotropium), and, rarely, methylxanthines (eg, theophylline). Treatment with a combination of bronchodilators with different durations and mechanisms of action is recommended when single-agent therapy is inadequate, as this can achieve improved bronchodilation while reducing the risk of side effects from a higher dose of a single agent.2 To improve health status and reduce the frequency of exacerbations, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Long Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommend adding ICS for symptomatic patients with GOLD stage III or IV disease, FEV1 < 50% predicted, and repeated exacerbations2, while the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines recommend consideration of ICS for patients with FEV1 < 50% predicted and one or more exacerbations in the last year requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids or antibiotics.1 The 50% FEV1 cut-off level is somewhat arbitrary, and many patients with FEV1 > 50% have multiple exacerbations each year.

PMC3034289_41	"The emergence of scientific evidence from multiple sources, including large clinical trials, has expanded our knowledge of COPD and fuelled a shift in our understanding of lung function decline and disease progression. Coupled with the emergence of a range of new drug treatments with differing mechanisms of action targeting different physiologic aspects of the disease, the first decade of this new century has become an exciting period in COPD management. The current challenge is to apply our understanding of disease processes to the design of optimal treatment algorithms for maintenance therapy, encompassing both established and emerging drug treatments. Landmark clinical trial data reinforce when foundation maintenance therapy should be introduced for symptomatic patients with COPD and its long-term health benefits. Finally, emerging evidence supports the early introduction of pharmacotherapies that relieve breathlessness, with the aim of slowing lung function decline and reducing the risk of acute exacerbations. However, further studies are required before evidence-based guidelines are able to assess adequately the potential of treatment for early-stage disease.

It also included close attention to symptoms and a longitudinal follow-up of 23 years.13 Although changes in lung function from adolescence to old age differ in males and females, analysis of the Framingham cohort revealed similar increases in the rate of FEV1 decline in both sexes, and beneficial effects of smoking cessation with age, notably among early quitters.13 Also noteworthy (and in contrast with the observations of Fletcher and Peto),17 symptomatic patients represented a susceptible group for progressive lung function decline, reinforcing current thinking that multidimensional influences impact COPD progression and that early diagnosis and intervention are critical. As such, COPD phenotyping and its impact on disease progression are areas of intense research.2022 Symptom status also appeared to contribute to the rate of lung function decline among a cohort of 519 patients with GOLD Stage I disease at baseline (according to prebronchodilator spirometry), in that patients with symptomatic disease had a faster decline in FEV1, increased respiratory care utilization, and lower QoL compared with those with asymptomatic disease at baseline.23

The risk of exacerbations was nevertheless lower in the treatment arm among patients not taking inhaled corticosteroids (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.631 to 0.989) [46]. This study has been criticized because of the low dose of NAC that was administered.   Patients with moderate-severe COPD on 1200mg versus 600mg daily of NAC demonstrated a more effective normalization of C-reactive protein levels and decreased serum IL-8 levels [47].

The feasibility of this procedure was demonstrated when 12 human lungs were removed at time of transplant, placed in an airtight ventilation chamber and the bronchus attached to a pneumotachometer [67].  Using a flexible bronchoscope, a radiofrequency catheter created passages in which stents were deployed.  The FEV1 increased from an average of 245mL at baseline to 447mL after the placement of three stents, and to 666mL after placement of 5 stents, confirming feasibility of the concept [67].  The safety of the procedure was assessed in 10 patients undergoing lobectomies for neoplasm [68].  The procedure was performed after thoracotomy and immediately before resection, and entailed the use of a bronchoscope to reach the target site, a doppler probe to avoid blood vessels at the target site, and the development of passages through the bronchial wall with a cautery probe [68].

Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy was performed following unilateral placement of EBVs in 6 COPD patients who had destruction of their left upper lobe [77].  By 90-day followup, there was a significant decrease in the ventilation and perfusion of the targeted left upper lobe (P = .01 and.02) though only one of the 6 achieved atelectasis of the targeted region.  Furthermore, the subjects had an increase in the ventilation and perfusion of the contralateral lung [77].  Placement of the valve leads to reduced ventilation, while concomitant decreased perfusion may be the result of subsequent hypoxic vasoconstriction of the same region [77].

The primary inflammatory cells in the airways of asthma patients are CD4+ T lymphocytes and eosinophils whereas in COPD, the predominant inflammatory cells are CD68+ macrophages, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and neutrophils, especially during exacerbations.4 These inflammatory changes contribute to airway swelling, luminal narrowing and a reduction in airflow.5 Airway mucus gland hyperplasia results in mucus hypersecretion that contributes to cough and sputum production and to the further impairment of airflow. The associated parenchymal destruction, called emphysema, reduces elastic recoil further diminishing airflow.

The apparent benefits of IHCS on the AECOPD rate increased with the proportion of patients taking IHCS prior to randomization.39 Many of the patients previously treated with IHCS were randomized to the placebo arm and so their outcomes actually represent the effects of IHCS withdrawal, shown previously to adversely affect outcomes in severe COPD, and contributed to an overestimate of the apparent benefits of IHCS therapy.39,40 Another concern with these studies is that patients who withdrew prematurely were not always followed to the end of the trial potentially biasing the intent-to-treat analysis.39 Some studies did not employ a weighted Poisson regression model and underestimated variability.39 Consequently, the 95% confidence intervals were under estimated, falsely attributing statistical significance to the results.40

This sequence, defining intermittent hypoxia, leads to oxidative stress, with production of reactive oxygen species.40 Hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction is a protective response to keep the ventilation-perfusion ratio at an optimum level by shunting blood away from hypoxemic areas. The traditional hypoxic model of pulmonary hypertension is based on the hypothesis that chronic hypoxia initiates vascular remodeling, leading to permanent changes in the pulmonary vasculature. Studies performed in vitro have elucidated the mechanisms underlying hypoxia-driven vascular changes. Barbera et al41 evaluated COPD patients undergoing lung resection and demonstrated that vascular changes contribute to vascular remodeling and putatively may have an effect on the vascular dynamics leading to pulmonary hypertension. Nocturnal hypoxia may induce endothelial cells to release cytokines, leading to cellular hypertrophy in the vessel wall and an increase in the extracellular matrix. In conclusion, the nocturnal hypoxic insult occurring during sleep-disordered breathing may contribute to chronic vascular remodeling, causing vascular endothelial damage and dysfunction, and increasing the risk of pulmonary hypertension in COPD.42

Ultimately, whether different treatment strategies would provide different outcomes for these groups will confirm or refute the clinical value of cluster analysis. This knowledge could lead to different pharmacological treatments and other interventions directed at specific phenotypic groups.88 We consider that achieving this goal is worthy of the research endeavor.

PMC3224650_7	"A brief review of the normal changes in respiration that occur with sleep onset and the various sleep stages is useful for understanding the changes occurring during sleep in patients with COPD. In healthy subjects, minute ventilation drops from wakefulness to non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, and drops further during REM sleep (about 15% compared with the awake value).22 Most of the drop in minute ventilation is due to a decrease in tidal volume not fully compensated by a concomitant increase in respiratory rate. There is a blunted ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, again with the greatest changes during REM sleep.23 Sleep-related hypoventilation has been demonstrated in COPD, particularly during REM sleep, with associated oxygen desaturation.24 Nocturnal oxygen desaturation in COPD is likely to be the consequence of the combined effects of physiological hypoventilation during sleep. However, there is evidence that some patients with awake PaO2 levels in the mildly hypoxemic range can also develop clinically significant nocturnal oxygen desaturation, which may predispose to pulmonary hypertension.25 Finally, possible mechanisms responsible for this reduction include respiratory muscle hypotonia, cephalic displacement of the diaphragm, and a decrease in lung compliance.26

The total recording time spent in bed with an oxygen saturation level 90% is defined as the T90. The minimal total recording time required for satisfactory analysis of nocturnal recordings is 2 hours. In one study, COPD patients with a T90  30% and a nadir oxygen saturation level of 85% were defined as desaturators and the others as nondesaturators.30 COPD desaturator patients may be identified by a clinical pattern of variables rather than by T90 alone, ie, T90, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and arterial carbon dioxide tension values, with the latter two variables being predictors of severity of nocturnal desaturation. Alveolar hypoventilation probably accounts for most of the oxygen desaturation. Becker et al31 measured minute ventilation during wakefulness, non-REM sleep, and REM sleep in normal subjects and in patients with COPD. The greater drop seen in minute ventilation in subjects with COPD may reflect increased dependence on accessory muscles that become hypotonic during sleep, particularly during REM sleep. An alternative explanation comes from the work of ODonoghue et al32 who found an even greater drop in minute ventilation during non-REM sleep in hypercapnic COPD patients.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is placed in group 3 of the WHO classification of PH, that is, PH associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxemia (Table 1) [1]. PH in COPD has been variably defined as resting mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) > 2025mmHg. PH in COPD adversely affects survival and exercise capacity and is associated with an increased risk of acute exacerbations. Recent studies have shown that endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation also play important roles in the pathogenesis of PH. The recent development of specific pulmonary vasodilators with antiproliferative properties has stimulated an immense interest in studying such drugs in PH secondary to COPD.

In patients with COPD and PH there is a reduction in the synthesis and/or release of NO from the lung [31].

Although it is tempting to speculate that such a bloodless phlebotomy may also result in improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics, gas exchange, and exercise tolerance, it is important to realize that ARBs are also non-specific vasodilators that can cause a modest decrease in mPAP as well as worsen PaO2.

PMC3437672_80	"The pathophysiology of PH in COPD is complex. A diagnosis of PH in COPD should prompt a search for other causes of PH, particularly left heart dysfunction, OSA, and PE before attributing the PH to COPD. PH in COPD adversely affects survival and exercise capacity and is associated with an increased risk of severe acute exacerbations. Unfortunately not all patients with COPD who meet criteria for LTOT benefit from it. Even in those who benefit from LTOT, such therapy may reverse PAP but cannot normalize it. Moreover, the recent discovery of the key roles of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in the pathogenesis of PH provides the rationale for considering specific pulmonary vasodilators that also possess antiproliferative properties and statins. Studies of pulmonary vasodilators and statins for PH secondary to COPD appear to show a promising role for such therapy in patients with more than mild PH (mPAP > 25mmHg) and warrant more research. Success of pulmonary vasodilator therapy appears to depend upon the degree of PH and the severity of hyperinflation. Such therapy is more likely to be successful when PH is moderate to severe (mPAP > 25mmHg) and hyperinflation is not playing a significant role, that is, IC/TLC is >25%. Although stable COPD patients with severe PH (mPAP > 3545mmHg) who probably represent a vascular phenotype or have concomitant IPAH warrant pulmonary vasodilator therapy, it may be worthwhile to try such therapy in stable COPD patients with less severe PH (mPAP 2535mmHg) especially if hyperinflation is not severe. On the other hand such therapy should be avoided when PH is mild or only during exercise or hyperinflation is playing a significant role, that is, IC/TLC is <25%.

As such, at very low lung volumes, or in the setting of widespread atelectasis, a derecruitment of the passive pulmonary vasculature leads to relative loss vascular surface area and can increase the PVR. This may occur in patients with sleep-disordered breathing during an apneic event. The more common scenario in clinical medicine is hyperinflation; at extremes of hyperinflation, such as severe air trapping from reactive airway disease or during the process known as auto-peep or breath stacking in mechanically ventilated patients, alveolar pressure may increase quite substantially, greatly exceeding pulmonary capillary and arteriolar pressure, thus compressing the pulmonary vasculature and increasing vascular resistance.[1618]

Although most patients with CRD, PH, and PHD have a normal left atrial pressure, this should not be assumed, especially in older subjects and those with obesity and sleep-disordered breathing, where left atrial hypertension is quite common and may be the predominant cause of PH.[2021] Pulmonary venous congestion is often very poorly tolerated in these patients, likely in part to the added deleterious effect on already compromised lung mechanics and gas exchange.

PMC3641739_15	"Arterial hypoxemia (pO2 < 60 mmHg) leads to stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid body and aorta. The primary physiological effects of peripheral chemoreceptor activation include intense systemic vasoconstriction (this overrides the direct systemic vasodilatory effect of hypoxia) to the renal, splanchnic, skeletal muscle, and cutaneous circulations, with cerebral and coronary artery vasodilation (head and heart circulation) as well as bradycardia. This redistributes relatively desaturated blood to the most vital organs and reduces myocardial oxygen demand. However, in the intact circulation, arterial hypoxia also stimulates increased ventilation (to correct hypercapnia and hypoxemia), which stimulates pulmonary stretch receptors that override the chemoreceptor vasoconstrictor response, leading to net systemic vasodilation and increased sympathetic tone to the heart. As a result, hypoxemia typically results in a fall in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and increased sympathetic input, both of which lead to increases in stroke volume, heart rate, and cardiac output. Chronic stimulation of the peripheral chemoreflex is likely an important reason for why patients with advanced lung disease commonly are in a relatively high cardiac output state. The increased cardiac output is also likely to be driven in part by reflex-mediated and direct sympathomimetic effects of dyspnea. In fact, patients with advanced COPD are in a constant state of increased sympathetic tone.[22yn24] In turn, acute oxygen administration in the setting of hypoxemia typically leads to rapid reductions in heart rate and cardiac output, likely from chemoreceptor deactivation and thus, sympatholysis.[9]

In the context of heart failure, edema results from net expansion of the extracellular volume compartment as a result of a fall in effective circulating volume, leading to arterial and renal baroreceptor stimulation and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-sympathetic (RAAS) cascade. Classically, this is associated with a reduced cardiac stroke volume and output as well as cardiac congestion. However, most patients with CRD and edema have normal or high cardiac outputs in the context of edema, and many have normal right atrial pressure.

A far stronger correlation was seen between edema and hypercapnia. Campbell et al., state oedema is rarely present if the pCO2 is normal. If oedema is present, the pCO2 is almost always raised. Typically, hypoxemia is more severe in the edematous patient with CRD; however, without concomitant hypercapnia, edema is usually not present.[2526] Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that hypercapnia, and likely hypoxemia, through direct effects and peripheral chemoreceptor reflex stimulation, leads to marked reductions in renal blood flow, even in the presence of a normal or increased cardiac output. In the context of reduced renal blood flow, the glomerular filtration rate typically remains normal, indicating that renal filtration fraction increases which promotes increased proximal tubular salt/water retention. This process is aided by RAAS activation, which is known to occur in CRD, likely primarily from the effects of hypoxemia and hypercapnia on chemoreceptor activation and disruptions in renal blood flow. Some have theorized that the associated systemic vasodilation of hypercapnia leads to a reduction in effective circulating volume (similar to cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome), RAAS activation, altered renal blood flow, and net renal sodium/water reabsorption.[27] Presumably, the added stimulus of an impaired cardiac output, seen in some patients with PHD, would only serve to amplify this feedback loop. It generally holds true that patients with chronic respiratory diseases typically associated with hypercapnia (i.e., COPD, thoracic cage abnormalities, obesity hypoventilation syndrome) are more likely to present with edema, as opposed to the diseases associated with hypoxia alone (i.e., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).

Ideally, right heart failure should be supported by both echocardiographic evidence of impaired RV systolic function and hemodynamics showing an increased right atrial pressure and depressed stroke volume index.

A key concept in this diagram is how these varying pathophysiologic stimuli affect the cardiopulmonary unit, and namely, the right ventricular-pulmonary arterial interaction (RV-PA interaction). The nature of the RV-PA interaction dictates the relative impact of any given degree of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular disease on overall circulatory homeostasis. If the RV-PA interaction permits for relative adaptation of the RV to RV afterload, typically, the degree of lung pathology will predominate over the degree of RV-PA pathology. In this case, the type I PHD phenotype is present, where the respiratory pathology dominates the clinical picture.

Volume expansion is common in PHD for the reasons highlighted above.

Thus, PVR is a far better measure of afterload than pressure. Practically speaking, this is why PH is far more common than the combination of PH and RV systolic failure in the context of PHD.

Naturally, invasive quantitation of hemodynamics is not plausible in every patient with pulmonary heart disease. However, the noninvasive assessment provides important insights into the pathophysiology of PH in an individual patient, and allows direct visualization of size, shape, and function changes that are fundamental to relative degrees of uncoupling of the right heart from the pulmonary circulation. Most patients with PHD have relatively mild PH related to mildly increased pulmonary vascular resistance with preserved RV systolic function, and thus, preserved RV stroke volume and cardiac output. In contrast, a small but important subset of patients with PHD has PH related to marked increases in the pulmonary vascular resistance, such that the RV can no longer adapt, and over RV systolic dysfunction results. In essence, the fundamental distinction between these two phenotypes is the degree of pulmonary vascular disease, which provides an important pathophysiologic foundation for the two different phenotypes of PHD, which will be discussed below.

PMC3641739_28	"More practically, patients with obesity, as well as obstructive and restrictive lung disease, must generate more negative pleural pressures to generate a normal tidal volume, given increased stiffness in the lung parenchyma itself or chest/abdominal constraint to normal ventilation. These larger swings in pleural pressure are transmitted to the heart and pulmonary vasculature, leading to relatively marked variation in pressure recordings obtained at end expiration versus inspiration. This is exaggerated further by lying supine, which adds further mechanical disadvantage to respiration in these patients. Thus, it is imperative that cardiac filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures are obtained at end expiration, when respiratory influence on hemodynamics is near zero, and not taken as the electronic average of pressures across the respiratory cycle. The latter method is a common default in the modern era, where pressure recordings are often measured by the catheterization laboratory's hemodynamic acquisition software and not over-read manually by the performing physician. This can lead to marked errors in the accuracy of the hemodynamic recordings. A common scenario would be the case of an obese patient with COPD, with a pulmonary artery occlusion (wedge) pressure of 28 mmHg at end expiration and 5 mmHg with inspiration, leading to an average wedge pressure recorded of 15 mmHg. The result is marked underestimation of the left atrial pressure, and thus, overestimation of the PVR, leading to erroneous diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension in a patient with decompensated left heart failure, with the potential for misguided pharmacotherapy.

In many patients, PHD is a marker of a severe underlying respiratory condition, with the direct and indirect effects of abnormal gas exchange being the critical determinants of altered cardiac performance.

Type I PHD will refer to subjects with chronic respiratory disease (CRD) and less than moderate degrees of RV systolic dysfunction, relatively mild increases in the pulmonary vascular resistance, with a cardiac index maintained within the normal range. This phenotype comprises the majority of PHD patients. In contrast, Type II PHD will refer to the smaller subset of patients with more marked increases in the pulmonary vascular resistance leading to a more advanced degree of right heart dysfunction, often characterized by marked RV enlargement, right heart congestion, and overt RV systolic dysfunction. Patients with this latter phenotype of PHD can often present in a fashion similar to patients with PAH. We will also discuss the treatment of PHD; however, we will do so largely in a theoretical context as the role for direct treatment of PHD and PH in CRD remains vastly understudied, and thus, poorly understood.

Pulmonary vascular disease, as measured by an increased PVR, not only adversely affects right heart function, but also further impairs gas exchange, ventilatory efficiency, and in some ways, adds a second disease to the underlying respiratory condition. The result is that patients with PHD, with and without significant pulmonary vascular disease, often have different overall clinical presentations that cannot be distinguished on the basis of a single metric. Therefore, it seems best to describe the overall differences in the clinical, echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and exercise physiology manifestations of the two groups. We recognize that dichotomization of PHD is subject to oversimplification, given an intermediate phenotype is missed; however, by providing the boundaries of the two patient phenotypes, we trust the clinician will be able to recognize the patient with PHD whom may lie somewhere in between.

PMC3641739_32	"We have deliberately avoided separating the PHD phenotypes on the basis of PA pressure severity, given the presence of an increased PA pressure does not necessarily denote the presence of pulmonary vascular disease nor what comprises the pressure. It is common to consider the PA pressure in CRD as being proportionate or disproportionate to the underlying respiratory condition. For example, most patients with CRD have mild PH (i.e., mean PA pressure < 35 mmHg) and this is typically considered proportionate to their underlying condition. So called disproportionate PH typically refers to patients with more severe PH (i.e., mean PA pressure > 35 mmHg). This terminology has practical value, especially at the extremes of PH and also when used in real-time to describe relative changes in PA pressure (i.e., by echo-Doppler examination) relative to changes in respiratory function (i.e., pulmonary function tests or radiographic findings) in the individual patient. However, describing PHD or PH in terms of their proportionality to an underlying respiratory condition is limited by the inherent subjectivity of what one considers proportionate or not, and still does not provide sufficient pathophysiologic information about the PH itself, nor its effects on the right heart. Moreover, there is such substantial overlap in the degree of PH using the proportionate schema, that this approach is not especially useful when trying to differentiate one patient from another. Another pitfall of using PA pressure as the focal point of PHD is that the pressure is most commonly derived via echo-Doppler examination, which may differ significantly from invasively derived PA pressure.[3536]

Therefore, increasing dyspnea will coincide with parallel deterioration of respiratory function and, in turn, will lead to transient, and typically modest, degrees of right heart congestion. Edema may or may not be present. Improvement in the underlying respiratory condition will typically coincide with improved edema and RV congestion. Exertional angina, syncope, or presyncope are distinctly uncommon, with a history of cough, wheezing, and respiratory infection often dominating the clinical picture. Aside from modest right heart congestion, the physical examination will typically reveal normal or increased arterial pulse volume and turgor. The left parasternal border is typically inactive, and the examination is more typically dominated by the respiratory findings than cardiovascular findings. The electrocardiogram may or may not manifest RVH, and the axis is either normal or vertical, typically without frank right axis deviation or RV strain. Oftentimes, the vertical axis is caused by lung hyperinflation and diaphragmatic flattening. Pulmonary function testing typically reveals relatively balanced reductions in the forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), with the relative proportion of these measures remaining stable even in the context of worsening respiratory function.

The RV dimensions will typically remain within normal range or increase to a mild degree, with the ratio of RV to LV diastolic dimensions typically not exceeding 1.0. Importantly, right ventricular systolic function typically remains within normal limits or at most, mildly reduced. Right ventricular systolic function may be quantified using relatively simple, reproducible methods such as tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) or by tissue Doppler imaging at the base of the RV. Both methods assess RV shortening along its longitudinal axis and do not require endocardial definition or volumetric estimates.[3738] The degree of TR present is variable, depending on the degree of volume excess and annular dilatation at the time the study is performed.

Importantly, patients with severe COPD and mild-to-moderate PH exhibit the same aerobic exercise capacity as COPD patients without PH; in both groups, exercise capacity was related to an exhausted ventilatory reserve and not to PA pressure, nor differences in the oxygen pulse, a surrogate for cardiac stroke volume.[43] Likewise, exercise-induced PH is common to sleep apnea, and was explained by a rise in the pulmonary artery wedge pressure with exertion, while the PVR remained within the normal range in all subjects.[20] Thus, the presence of exercise-induced PH should not necessarily be taken to indicate that pulmonary vascular disease is present, nor that the PH or RV function are in fact the source of the functional limitations.

PMC3641739_4	"It is useful to think of the heart and lung as functioning as a coupled unit. We will consider coupling at two anato-physiological interfaces. First, there is the right heart-pulmonary vascular interface. The compliant and relatively nonmuscular RV is normally coupled to a low impedence pulmonary circulation, permitting the RV to eject large volumes of blood at low filling pressures and at a low energetic cost. As such, the RV can be thought of as a flow generator, in contrast to the LV which generates a great deal more pressure at the same level of flow. The second interface occurs at the alveolar-pulmonary vascular level. With elastic recoil of the chest-lung unit, alveolar pressure is 0 mmHg at end-expiration. Thus, at the base of the lung, or West Lung Zone 3 (where the bulk of ventilation and perfusion occur in upright posture), alveolar pressure does not exert any resistance effect on the pulmonary vasculature.[4] Changes in pleural pressure generation and transmission can be thought of as another interface between the heart and lung and will be incorporated into the discussion.

Moreover, these patients demonstrated lesser degrees of pulmonary obstruction than subjects without pulmonary vascular disease. Pulmonary sarcoid seems to have a particular predilection for pulmonary vascular involvement, and represents the diagnosis that we most commonly see in our Type II PHD patients. Other parenchymal lung disorders that present a higher risk of significant pulmonary vascular involvement include Langerhans cell histiocytosis and interstitial lung disease associated with scleroderma.[5254] Combined pulmonary fibrosis with emphysema can also be associated with a severe PH phenotype. A subgroup of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients can also manifest a more severe PHD phenotype, with the degree of PH, pulmonary vascular disease, and right heart dysfunction more closely resembling PAH than a typical Group III PH patient.[55] Taken together, clinical observations as well as the published literature indicate that subgroups of many different forms of chronic respiratory disease can manifest a more severe PHD phenotype. This phenotypic distinction cannot be made by PA pressure estimation alone. Therefore, clinicians need be aware of the varying clinical, CPET, echocardiographic, and hemodynamic parameters that set a Type I PHD patient apart from a Type II patient.

Second, patients must have evidence of RV systolic dysfunction on the basis of the increased PVR. This combination of an increased PVR and depressed RV function indicates relative uncoupling of the RV and pulmonary vasculature, and represents the basic physiologic paradigm that lends to both the circulatory limitation to exertion as well as the propensity toward hemodynamic improvements in response to pulmonary vasodilating therapy.[5859] Patients with Type I PHD have mild pulmonary vascular disease and mild RV dysfunction, and thus, a relatively small separation or uncoupling between RV function and afterload. This does not lend toward a significant circulatory limitation to exertion or a hemodynamic benefit from PH specific therapies. In contrast, patients described as Type II PHD meet both criteria, with RV-PA uncoupling that more closely resembles that seen in patients with PAH.

PMC3641739_47	"In most patients with PHD, the degree of pulmonary vascular disease is mild and relates to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, remodeling, and loss of lung surface area. The use of pulmonary vasodilators in patients with relatively mild PH in association to CRD tends to make patients more hypoxic, as was seen in a cohort of patients with COPD treated for 12 weeks with bosentan, where the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient increased and functional capacity worsened.[60] In contrast, patients with Type II PHD exhibit PVR elevations that are well beyond that seen from HPV alone. Moreover, due to a reduced cardiac output, these subjects often have reduced mixed venous oxygen saturation. Therefore, a drop in the PVR may leave HPV relatively intact, and also improve mixed venous oxygen saturation, thus preventing a net fall in arterial oxygen saturation, similar to what occurs in PAH. The consequent reduction in right atrial pressure may also improve oxygenation via alleviation of right to left shunting through a patent foramen ovale. Therapy selection may also matter, as inhaled therapies as well as oral sildenafil are less apt to cause increased hypoxemia through vasodilation than calcium channel blockers or acute administration of intravenous epoprostenol.[61] The inhaled therapies deliver drug to ventilated areas and thus tend to preserve V/Q matching, while sildenafil is relatively more pulmonary selective as compared to calcium channel blockers and parenteral prostacyclins. Of note, no studies have investigated the effects of chronic, gradual titration of parenteral prostacyclin therapy in a severe pulmonary heart disease phenotype. It may be that slow, steady titration of parenteral prostacyclin therapies in this context do not lead to increases in intrapulmonary shunting as was seen with acute intravenous administration. This may be especially true when the PH phenotype is robust, such that the improved PVR and right heart function improve gas exchange, thus offsetting the chance that a modest increase in intrapulmonary shunt would lead to a significant increase in hypoxia.

The translation of improved circulatory reserve into overall clinical and functional improvements represents a complex physiologic algorithm, where the net improvement in functional capacity should occur due to a change in the balance of circulatory and ventilatory dependent functional limitations following treatment. Indeed, it is challenging to precisely predict the extent to which improved cardiac function will improve overall functional capacity in the context of significant pulmonary disease. However, it is logical that there must be a requisite baseline level of right heart dysfunction and increased pulmonary arterial afterload present, such that there is a coexisting cardiovascular limitation to exercise as well.

As such, whether there is no change or a modest improvement in circulatory function following PH specific therapy, the relative change in circulatory reserve is not sufficient to offset the predominant and uncorrected ventilatory limitation.

Interestingly, a recent post hoc analysis of a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in IPF showed that the subgroup of patients with RV dysfunction and RV hypertrophy improved their six minute walk distance in response to sildenafil, while subjects without RV dysfunction and hypertrophy did not respond to therapy.[62] Figure 2 illustrates the relative balance of respiratory disease and corresponding ventilatory reserve as well as the degree of circulatory impairment and reserve in subjects with Type I and Type II PHD at baseline and in response to PH specific therapy.

This unique vascular response was first noted in the feline circulation, but is present in varying intensity across mammalian species once the alveolar pO2 drops below 50-60 mmHg.[56] Mechanisms involved in HPV include direct oxygen sensing within the vascular smooth muscle, changes in redox state, and altered paracrine signaling from the vascular endothelium.[6] Generally, HPV leads to a rise in the PA pressure; however, the pulmonary hemodynamic responses to hypoxia are quite variable. Studies in healthy human volunteers and patients with COPD have shown that pulmonary hypertension in response to acute hypoxia represents an aggregate effect of both a modest increase in the cardiac output (CO) and increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).[79] The variability in the HPV response is likely multifactorial, but seems to relate in part to the degree of muscularization of the pulmonary arteries at baseline, modulating effects of blood pH, and possibly genetic predisposition.[10] Acute correction of hypoxia with supplemental oxygen exerts the opposite hemodynamic effects, with the fall in pulmonary artery pressure typically occurring due to reductions in heart rate, stroke volume, and PVR; as with HPV, changes in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) to oxygen are variable. In response to hypoxia or hyperoxia, the respective rise and fall in mPAP varies in proportion to the magnitude change in pO2.[9]

This serves to lessen the amplifying effect of a falling pH on HPV.[714] Thus, patients with both hypoxia and hypercapnia (i.e., obesity hypoventilation) are at greater risk of developing PH in response to hypoxia; this may explain why patients with sleep-disordered breathing generally require both daytime hypoxia and hypercapnia to develop significant daytime pulmonary hypertension.[15] We will discuss important extracardiac physiological effects of hypercapnia below.

PMC3653890_1	"COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is progressive and not fully reversible; the latest severity categorization also includes exacerbation frequency and symptom burden as key features.1 COPD is associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response which is responsible for the airway abnormalities and architectural distortion of the lung parenchyma. In affected individuals lung function deteriorates progressively over several years, with increasing symptoms such as cough, sputum production, and dyspnoea. Acute exacerbations are defined by increased cough, dyspnea, or increased sputum purulence from baseline,2 and punctuate the disease process with a deleterious impact on patients daily activities and well-being.3 Frequent exacerbations are associated with more rapid decline of lung function4 and are one of the greatest costs to the health economy, partly through hospital admissions, and partly through loss of work days.5 Although mainly categorized by airflow limitation, in many patients the disease seems to be associated with several extra-pulmonary manifestations. What is unclear at present is whether these manifestations are directly related to COPD or are just an independent consequence of the exposure to common causal effects such as tobacco smoking and inactivity. The most widely recognized manifestations include the presence of concomitant cardiovascular disease, skeletal muscle dysfunction, osteoporosis, and clinical depression/anxiety.6 These co-morbidities interact to increase the risk of hospitalization and mortality in COPD patients, especially as the airway obstruction becomes more severe.7 The main goals in management of COPD are improving health status, reducing symptoms, preserving lung function decline, preventing exacerbations, and reducing mortality. This review outlines the pharmacological management of stable COPD.

M1 receptors are expressed in peribronchial ganglia, whilst M3 receptors are present on bronchial smooth muscle cells; their relationship to one another is shown in Figure 2. Both mediate bronchomotor tone and reflex bronchoconstriction. M2 receptors are located in the post ganglionic para-sympathetic nerve and act as auto receptors. Agonistic stimulation of these receptors provides feedback and inhibition of further acetylcholine release; thus, optimal inhibition of the parasympathetic pathway would be achieved by selectively blocking M1 and M3 receptors.43

Its onset of action is within minutes, with peak activity occurring between 1 and 2 hours and duration of action approximately 4 hours in the majority of patients.43 In a systematic review, combination of LABAs with ipratropium showed a small benefit in pre bronchodilator FEV1 of borderline statistical significance;14 however, for the most part LABAs were superior.

Nevertheless, drug choice for the individual patient may still suggest LABA as a good choice for some, ie, in patients with severe glaucoma; thus current guidance places the 2 classes of drug equal in therapy algorithms.1,5 Few head to head trials of LAMAs have been carried out, with the notable exception of GLOW2 (tiotropium versus glycopyrronium),45 which concluded that the products were equivalent in terms of trough FEV1, dyspnoea score, and exacerbation reduction. Aclidinium has been studied alongside tiotropium, but this trial was a small study of crossover design,46 and therefore larger, more definitive studies are still needed. A summary of clinical effects, as demonstrated by the various LAMA trials, is shown in Table 3; since most effects (with the exception of speed of onset) appear to be roughly equivalent between the 3 drugs they have been tabulated together.

The drug is not extensively metabolized but the portion that is undergoes hydrolysis into two major metabolites, a carboxylic acid derivative and an alcohol derivative, neither of which have any affinity for any of the muscarinic receptor subtype.

Varenicline is a selective nicotinic receptor partial agonist. It mimics the effects of nicotine on dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens when given alone but attenuates this response to a subsequent nicotine challenge and reduces nicotine self-administration.112 Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin in the central nervous system.112 During nicotine withdrawal, levels of these neurotransmitters fall, leading to withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, in limiting reuptake the symptoms of withdrawal are attenuated. All three modalities113115 have proven to be effective compared to placebo in smoking cessation, with available evidence favoring the superiority of Varenicline over Bupropion. There is limited direct evidence between Varenicline and NRT, and only a few heterogeneous trials comparing Bupropion to NRT; overall it is likely that both are superior to NRT.113115 Post-marketing surveillance has raised subsequent concerns about possible between Varenicline and suicidal ideation, such that a recent systematic review (mainly of evidence in populations unselected for psychiatric disease) advised using it only with caution in patients with pre-existing psychiatric problems.116 Conversely a recent RCT specific to schizophrenic patients found if effective and safe.117

The cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform 3A4 is responsible for aliphatic oxidation of salmeterol base, which is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation, with the major metabolite being alpha- hydroxysalmeterol and with subsequent elimination predominantly in the feces.23 Formoterol is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP450 enzymes and undergoes glucuronidation and O-demethylation.

PR and pharmacological therapy are not competitive but rather, must work closely together, if they are to result in a more successful outcome. One particular study has shown that a better outcome (exercise tolerance) of PR can be obtained when it is associated with long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators.5 Moreover, PR has been shown to be the most effective nonpharmacological intervention for improving health status in COPD patients and has become a standard of care for COPD patients.3

Sputum and mucus are commonly used interchangeably, but these are distinct substances. While mucus is generally cleared by cilia, the ciliated epithelium becomes damaged with chronic inflammation and the increased volume of secretions often requires clearance by cough. Sputum refers to the expectorated secretions.3 CB is commonly defined as the presence of a chronic, productive cough and sputum production for at least 3 consecutive months in 2 consecutive years. This review presents the normal anatomy and physiology related to airway mucus and the pathophysiology of increased mucus production in COPD.

PMC3908831_1	"Airway mucus is secreted by goblet cells found in the superficial mucosa and the mucous glands in the submucosa. Goblet cells decrease in number further into the airways, and they eventually disappear at the level of the terminal bronchioles. The quantity of mucous glands, which produce the majority of the airway mucus, decrease distally as they approach the respiratory bronchioles. The mucosa is a surface layer of pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells that have cilia on their luminal surfaces. The rhythmic beating of the cilia enables the mucociliary elevator that transports mucus and liquid, as well as inhaled particles, pathogens, and dissolved chemicals, from distal to proximal airways. After the mucus ascends the trachea, it is driven through the vocal cords by the larynx ciliary epithelium. The mucus is then swallowed after the pharynx is entered. The vocal cords are covered by squamous epithelium, so they do not have cilia, but they promote cough clearance by closing, while expiratory pressure builds; they then open suddenly so airflow is forceful.4,5 The secreted mucins  in particular, the polymeric mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B  serve as the organizing framework of the mucus gel in the airways. The mucins also prevent barrier dehydration, present carbohydrate ligands to sequester the pathogens, and via binding to other components of the secretion, they have the potential to act as sinks for host-protective proteins and peptides.6

These differences could account for the inconsistent relationship between CB and mortality. First, as mentioned previously, the definition used of mucus accumulation with or without spirometry-defined airflow obstruction varies. The negative studies use chronic phlegm production44 or a combination of respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, or wheeze).45 The positive studies use the classic CB definition,31,38 or symptoms of chronic mucus hypersecretion,41,42 or chronic phlegm27,43. All of the symptoms are self-reported, and so responses may be varied depending on how the question is phrased. Second, standard of care likely varies in the populations being studied, as the research on this subject matter includes patients from all areas of the globe at different points in time. Third, the association of mortality and chronic sputum, phlegm production, or CB may be influenced by factors such as the presence of COPD or smoking history. Most of the studies report results that have adjusted for these covariates, but unmeasured differences associated with the presence of these factors may influence the findings. Fourth, some authors suggest that the relationship between mucus accumulation and mortality is further affected by severity of airflow obstruction,27 infection,41 and age.38

Despite being well matched for age, sex, body mass index, and baseline airflow obstruction, the authors were not able to show that the hyperinflators experienced more dyspnea than the nonhyperinflators.

This contention is supported by studies that show reduced limb muscle fatigue and corresponding improvements in perceived leg discomfort when the work of breathing is mechanically unloaded during exercise in healthy humans73 and in patients with COPD.74 In theory, dynamic hyperinflation and the associated increase in work and oxygen cost of breathing may compromise blood flow to the periphery, leading to compromised oxygen delivery and therefore causing increased leg fatigue. Indeed, studies that have unloaded the respiratory muscles of hyperinflated patients with bronchodilators or heliox resulted in an improvement in indices of limb muscle fractional oxygen extraction.75,76 For example, Louvaris et al77 recently demonstrated that improving operating lung volumes in hyperinflated COPD patients with heliox enhanced oxygen delivery to the quadriceps muscles during exercise by increasing arterial oxygen content and blood flow to the quadriceps muscles.

A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this association as recently described,84 including increased intrathoracic pressures, cardiovascular effects, increased lung volume, altered gas exchange, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and endothelial dysfunction. Collectively, these cardiovascular consequences of lung hyperinflation likely contribute, in highly variable combinations, to the reduced cardiac performance observed in some COPD patients during exercise.20,85 However, it should be acknowledged that not all studies have been able to demonstrate a direct link between dynamic hyperinflation and cardiac performance during exercise.

Thus, it is difficult to directly demonstrate a causeeffect relationship between hyperinflation and exercise performance because interventions that reduce hyperinflation may also improve any one or a combination of these contributory factors to varying degrees.

For example, peak VT relative to predicted vital capacity was found to be the best predictor of peak aerobic capacity (r=0.68, P<0.0005) in 105 patients with COPD.13 Work from other groups supports these results by showing a significant correlation between resting IC and peak work rate and peak oxygen uptake, particularly in patients with demonstrable expiratory flow limitation at rest.88 The notion that lung hyperinflation is inversely related to exercise tolerance is also supported, albeit indirectly, by studies showing statistically significant correlations between improvements in resting and exercise IC and improvements in peak oxygen uptake and cycle endurance time following different interventions.46,56,89,90

Obese patients consistently have a reduced expiratory reserve volume (or FRC) proportional to the magnitude of obesity.99,108,110,113120 Total lung capacity is usually not affected (ie, it remains within the lower limits of normal values), although some studies report decreases in cases of very severe obesity (body mass index >45 kg/m2).110,112,121 Obesity is associated with a small decrease in FEV1 and forced vital capacity (although they remain within normal values)108,122,123 and the FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio is preserved.124 The physiological consequences of a combination of obesity and COPD are not well known and could theoretically provide advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, both of these pathologies may have opposing effects in terms of lung volumes, COPD being primarily hyperinflating and obesity being deflating. This could provide an advantage to patients with COPD who are obese by reducing the deleterious effects of dynamic hyperinflation. On the other hand, this combination could increase mechanical loading and airway closure,125 and thus worsen trapping of air in the lung.

PMC3933347_21	"While very few studies have addressed the impact of the combination of obesity and COPD on lung volumes, available results suggest that compared with normal weight patients, obese patients with COPD have reduced TLC and FRC126129 and that lower lung volumes are maintained throughout exercise.126,128,129 Obese patients with COPD still hyperinflate to a similar degree ( IC from rest to peak exercise capacity) than their normal weight counterparts.126,128,129 Obesity in COPD appears to have a deflating effect at rest, and as a consequence, even if patients hyperinflate at a similar rate, they remain at lower volumes during exercise. Therefore, these studies all report that obese patients with COPD have either preserved or increased exercise capacity,126129 except when walking is the testing modality.127 Mechanistic data126 showed that the elastic properties of the lung were better preserved and that diaphragmatic function appeared not to be better in obese patients with COPD. Also, the increased metabolic load induced by obesity appeared to be compensated by an increased ventilatory efficiency (ie, lower ventilatory equivalent for CO2) in these patients. The precise mechanisms by which obesity and COPD interact to affect lung volumes are presently not well known. They are likely influenced by several factors, such as COPD phenotype42 and fat distribution.96

Women with COPD appear to be more susceptible to resting hyperinflation, despite lower tobacco use and younger age.135 When restricted to emphysema, women also present a different pattern of disease compared with men, ie, smaller airway lumen and thicker airway walls.136,137 During constant work rate cycle exercise testing at the same relative intensity, women with COPD hyperinflated at a rate similar to that in men ( IC).138 However, considering their smaller lung volumes, they reached a critical inspiratory reserve volume sooner than men and thus stopped exercise earlier than men. Similar results were obtained in another sample of COPD patients.139 It would appear that women may be more susceptible to the deleterious effects of COPD because of their smaller respiratory systems compared with men.

PMC3933347_23	"In order to calculate lung hyperinflation at baseline, two subdivisions of the vital capacity must be measured. These are the IC and the expiratory reserve volume (Figure 1B).140 Methods used for assessment of these parameters in COPD are body plethysmography, nitrogen washout, and helium dilution techniques.141 Body plethysmography is considered the gold standard. This test is performed in a body plethysmograph allowing measurement of intrathoracic gas while airflow is occluded. Based on Boyles law,142 changes in thoracic volumes caused by a compression or decompression of the gas in the lungs during respiratory maneuvers can be computed. FRC is thus obtained and constitutes the key measurement of static hyperinflation. A minimum of three values must be obtained, and the difference between the lowest and the highest FRC must be within 5% to be considered reliable. The mean value is then reported. In elderly healthy subjects, residual volume and FRC represent 30% and 55% of TLC, respectively.130 In COPD, these values can be increased to 70% and 85% of the TLC for residual volume and FRC, respectively.143 Usually, lung volumes/capacities exceeding 120%130% of the predicted value are considered to be clinically relevant in COPD, but this remains arbitrary given that no consensus about the definition or severity of lung hyperinflation is available.131,141 It seems that the FRC calculated by body plethysmography is overestimated because it includes both ventilated and nonventilated lung compartments.130,142 In contrast, nitrogen washout and helium dilution techniques underestimate FRC in the presence of severe airflow obstruction or emphysema.32,140 Complete details about these three techniques are available in the latest American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society task force document.141 Finally, because of a lack of standardization, radiographic techniques144147 are not commonly used clinically to measure static hyperinflation in COPD.32 In fact, lung volumes calculated from radiographic techniques are based on the volume of gas within the outline of the thoracic cage and thus include the volume of tissue as well as the lung gas volume.140 This method is usually reserved for patients with a limited ability to correctly perform the other techniques. Nevertheless, high-resolution computed tomography might constitute a useful upcoming technique to assess hyperinflation in COPD.32

PMC3933347_24	"Dynamic hyperinflation is determined from assessment of EELV (Figure 1B). This volume can be used interchangeably with FRC, although it is usually more appropriate to use it during exercise because this value is temporarily increased. EELV is commonly measured during exercise or any condition increasing minute ventilation by assessment of serial IC measurements as recently described by Guenette et al.41 As for the resting EELV, a minimum of three IC maneuvers must be performed at rest. Values within 10% or 150 mL of the largest acceptable IC are usually considered reproducible. During exercise, patients are asked to take a deep inspiration after a normal expiration at specific intervals ranging from 1 to 3 minutes as well as at symptom limitation and during recovery. Because TLC remains stable during exercise,148,149 a temporary decrease in IC reflects a temporary increase in EELV (Figure 1B and D). More than 80% of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD showed significant increases in EELV during exercise.11,13,46,150 This volume has been shown to be reliably measurable and is responsive to treatment in COPD.57,89 Moreover, inspiratory-to-total lung capacity ratio <25% has also been used as a prognostic tool in COPD.151 A recent study showed that reduction of the inspiratory reserve volume (IC  VT, Figure 1A and B) reflecting room to breathe was even more related to exercise dyspnea than EELV42 (Figure 1B). Finally, other methods such as optoelectronic plethysmography152 and respiratory inductance plethysmography153 are available for the assessment of dynamic hyperinflation, but they are still mainly used for research purposes in COPD.

Rather, pharmacotherapy delays the development of restrictive ventilatory mechanics during exercise by deflating the lungs and decreasing EELV at rest. The resulting increase in resting IC causes a parallel downward shift in operating lung volumes during exercise in comparison with exercise performed without bronchodilation (Figure 3).41,150 Thus, for any given exercise intensity or ventilation, patients breathe on the more linear portion of the respiratory system pressurevolume curve, with attendant improvements in neuromechanical coupling and, by extension, dyspnea. However, the absolute magnitude of dynamic hyperinflation does not change, and may even increase during peak exercise, reflecting the higher levels of ventilation that can be achieved following pharmacotherapy.10,45,90

The effects of these interventions on dyspnea are probably mostly related to unloading of the inspiratory muscles during exercise.155,157160 Respiratory muscle function is often impaired in patients with COPD.161 As previously described, these muscles have to overcome higher elastic and threshold loads during exercise which increases the work and oxygen cost of breathing in comparison with healthy subjects.26,162 Optimal continuous positive airway pressure reduces the elastic work of breathing throughout inspiration, counterbalances intrinsic positive end expiratory pressure, and takes away the threshold load on the inspiratory muscles while pressure support provides variable resistive and elastic unloading of the ventilatory muscles.156,163

PMC3933347_4	"Lung volumes can be divided into several compartments defined by the normal cycle of tidal breathing and the maximum capacity to inhale and exhale (Figure 1A). In health, during relaxed tidal breathing, the lungs tend to return to a basal level of inflation, which is termed functional residual capacity (FRC) or end-expiratory lung volume (EELV). During the hyperpnea of exercise, both tidal volume (VT) and respiratory rate increase to meet the increased ventilatory requirements. Therefore, maintenance of stable lung volumes requires that expiratory muscles must be recruited to elevate pleural and alveolar pressure, increase expiratory flow, and force the increased VT to be completely exhaled before the next inhalation.25

With advancing age, damage to the connective tissue of the lung occurs, resulting in a reduction of the lung elastic recoil pressure.28 The equilibrium point (FRC or EELV) therefore occurs at a higher lung volume than in younger subjects, with a consequence of an increased volume of air remaining in the lung at the end of spontaneous expirations. This is referred to as static hyperinflation, which exists at rest.28 In COPD with emphysema, the lung recoil pressure is further reduced by a reduced elastic load related to smoking or 1-antitrypsin deficiency.29 Therefore, the elastic recoil pressure of the respiratory system falls to zero at a larger FRC or EELV, resulting in more static hyperinflation.

Of note, the investigators found that a history of snoring was a poor predictor of OSA.85 Conversely, patients with OSA who have respiratory complaints typical of COPD and the presence of risk factors for COPD, most prominently cigarette smoking, should have a screening spirometry test performed. If there is clinical concern for nocturnal desaturations based on daytime oxygen saturations that are less than 93%, this may be evaluated by nocturnal oximetry.

PMC3986113_20	"The presence of OSA is determined by the frequency of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep (the AHI) that a person has on a polysomnogram. While the definition of apnea in adults is widely accepted as the absence of airflow for at least 10 seconds, the definition of hypopnea is not. The two common scoring criteria for hypopnea are the reduction of airflow for at least 10 seconds with either a 4% oxygen desaturation or a 3% oxygen desaturation with subsequent arousal.

PMC3986113_21	"A common alternative to the AHI for determining the presence and severity of OSA is based on the RDI. Prior to 2008, the term RDI was equivalent to the current definition of AHI. Since 2008 and currently, there are two accepted definitions of RDI. Unattended overnight polysomnograms performed in an ambulatory setting (also known as portable or home sleep studies) have been a common modality for screening for OSA in high risk patient populations. These studies utilize a limited number of channels, and exact sleep time and arousals from sleep as determined by electroencephalography are often not available. Index time is utilized in place of sleep time, and this is the recording time of the study minus any amount of time when surrogate markers of wakefulness are present. The RDI in this situation is defined by the number of apnea and hypopnea (4% oxygen desaturation definition) events per index time. The alternate definition includes respiratory-event related arousals (RERAs) in addition to apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. RERAs are events of increasing respiratory effort leading to an arousal without an associated oxygen desaturation. Although RERAs represent disruptions in sleep and can lead to daytime sleepiness, they do not contribute to the diagnosis of OSA. Intermittent nocturnal oxygen desaturations observed in patients with COPD may often be independent of increased upper airway resistance or collapse. There must be careful evaluation of the airflow pattern to avoid over-scoring these events as hypopneas rather than oxygen desaturations. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) defines OSA by at least five events per hour of sleep with associated symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, respiratory pauses during sleep, or gasping arousals.86 It is important to note that research trials over time have varied in the cutoff points for defining sleep apnea with a range of an AHI of five events per hour with symptoms present to 20 events per hour.

Central sleep apnea (CSA) and complex sleep apnea (CompSA) are two broad categories of sleep apnea, but data on the association and combined consequences with COPD are lacking. CSA is repetitive cessation of breathing without associated respiratory effort during sleep due to hyperventilation with hypocapnia-associated respiratory pauses or chronic hypoventilation. Hyperventilation is the mechanism for primary CSA, high altitude central apnea, or CSA associated with congestive heart failure (CHF), while chronic hypoventilation CSA is commonly associated with neuromuscular disease and chronic opiate medication use. In 2012, the AASM released a meta-analysis and practice guidelines for the treatment of adults with the various CSA syndromes, wherein treatment often consists of maintenance of adequate ventilation via CPAP or bilevel positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy.87

Among the major trials assessing the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids during exacerbations, limited data was reported about sleep disturbances or weight changes.103106 A Cochrane Review in 2005 reported an odds ratio of developing insomnia among patients treated with systemic corticosteroid for an acute exacerbation of COPD of 3.53 (P=0.001).103 Aaron et al compared 74 patients treated with prednisone 40 mg daily for 10 days with 73 patients treated with placebo.107 This study found an increased rate of insomnia among the corticosteroid arm, with nearly half of these patients reporting insomnia (48% versus 21%, P=0.001). In addition, weight gain was reported by 13% of the patients who received corticosteroids compared to 1% patients who did not. Significant and persistent weight gain has been observed with chronic and recurrent courses of systemic corticosteroids in a myriad of inflammatory conditions. Steroid-induced skeletal muscle atrophy is also a known side effect of systemic corticosteroids, especially in chronic use. Decramer et al found significant respiratory and quadriceps muscle weakness among the patients with a cumulative daily dose of 4.3 mg of methylprednisolone from steroid burst treatments over a 6-month period for exacerbations of their COPD.108 However, this same acquired weakness was not observed in a study of 25 patients with stable COPD who were given 30 mg of prednisolone daily for 2 weeks.109 This suggests that the combined effect of the systemic corticosteroid and an acute inflammatory state drives the development of muscular weakness. This muscular weakness can affect the previously described compensatory mechanisms patients with COPD and overlap syndrome utilize during sleep. Sleep disruption and weight gain have not been commonly reported with the use of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD.

The Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial demonstrated improved survival among patients with COPD with long-term oxygen therapy, although this trial did not specifically investigate patients with nocturnal desaturations alone.16 The 2013 Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommend that supplemental oxygen therapy be provided to patients whose oxygen saturations fall below 88% or who have a PO2 less than 55 mmHg during wakefulness or PO2 between 55 and 60 mmHg with evidence of pulmonary hypertension, CHF or polycythemia.1 The goal of oxygen administration is to increase the baseline PO2 to 60 mmHg or pulse oximeter reading to 90% during the day.

The patient has poor symptom control of COPD but also has symptoms consistent with OSA, including daytime somnolence and morning headaches. Fatigue and sleepiness should not be attributed to COPD. Given the extent of symptoms and relative hypoxia by daytime pulse oximetry, a polysomnogram should be performed in similar patients to evaluate for OSA. It is important to note that when evaluating a patient with potential overlap syndrome, intermittent nocturnal oxygen desaturations may resolve with treatment of the underlying sleep apnea. Priority should be given to the treatment of OSA before instituting supplemental oxygen. When appropriate, patients with potential overlap syndrome who are already using nocturnal supplemental oxygen should initially have their polysomnogram and subsequent PAP titration study performed without supplemental oxygen. If, as in this case, PAP therapy alone does not correct the patients nocturnal hypoxemia, the additional use of supplemental oxygen may be required to support their oxygen needs.

PMC3986113_4	"There are two main regions in the upper airway that are responsible for increased airway airflow resistance during sleep, the base of the tongue and the soft palate. These structures approximate the posterior wall of the pharynx resulting in anterior-posterior narrowing, especially prominent in a supine body position. In addition, lateral pharyngeal wall intrusion occurs due to negative intraluminal pressure during inspiration and a reduction in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone, resulting in circumferential airway collapse. Oropharyngeal crowding from redundant soft tissue seen among obese individuals and people from certain ethnic backgrounds predisposes them to obstructive sleep apnea.2527 In a similar way, mucosal inflammation such as chronic rhinitis, which is often seen in cigarette smoking, may contribute to this phenomenon.2830 The normal circadian change in airway caliber also contributes to a mild bronchoconstriction during sleep and an increase in airway resistance.31 Finally, increased diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle effort is required to overcome the upper airway resistance and maintain adequate airflow to the lower respiratory tract. This can be particularly difficult in patients with comorbid intrathoracic airway resistance, due to chronic inflammation and hyperinflation, and increased dead space ventilation at baseline.

There is no data, however, to suggest that mucolytic agents benefit patients with COPD or overlap syndrome, and recent guidelines do not recommend routine use of mucolytic agents.1

PMC3986113_6	"In addition to upper airway luminal changes, thoracic respiratory physiology is an important aspect of sleep and the overlap syndrome. Alterations in minute ventilation and functional residual capacity (FRC) occur in both non-REM and REM sleep, but are more profound within REM sleep. Despite a decrease in metabolic activity during sleep, it is normal to have an increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 210 mmHg due to a reduction in tidal volume during non-REM sleep and a rapid-shallow breathing pattern within REM sleep.33,34 In normal individuals, a reduction in ventilation by approximately 40% occurs during REM compared to daytime breathing.33,35 This can have important consequences for individuals who have difficulty with alveolar ventilation due to hyperinflation and increased dead space ventilation. The FRC is the particular lung volume that is determined by the opposing elastic recoil forces of the thoracic wall and the lungs and often acts as an oxygen reservoir for the lungs. Body position during sleep, supine or lateral recumbent, creates external thoracic restriction. Attenuation of chest wall muscle tone, especially seen in REM sleep, reduces the outward elastic force of the thorax. These two conditions cause a reduction in the FRC and, in combination with reduced tidal volume during sleep, result in hypoventilation and decreased oxygen partial pressure(pO2) levels, even among normal subjects.
"	HP_0002791
PMC3986113_7	"This process can be accentuated in patients with COPD and hyperinflation. As lung volumes increase from hyperinflation or air-trapping, the curvature of the diaphragm flattens. Diaphragmatic fattening leads to diminished excursion and efficiency, creating an increased dependence on compensatory mechanisms such as accessory muscle use (Figure 3). The skeletal muscle atonia that occurs during REM sleep requires that respiratory efforts are again dependent on the less functional diaphragm. In addition to this, the typical REM-related rapid-shallow breathing pattern increases dead-space ventilation, further contributing to a reduction in alveolar ventilation. This is the major cause for the profound oxygen desaturations observed during sleep in patients with COPD and overlap syndrome.

PMC3986113_8	"The final component of respiratory physiology that has important consequence in COPD and overlap syndrome during sleep is the neurochemical response of the respiratory cycle. During wakefulness, the central drive to breathe is affected by both hypercapnia and hypoxemia. During sleep these responses are blunted, allowing for more profound hypoxia and hypercapnia than observed while awake.33,35,36 The ventilatory and arousal response during sleep has been observed to be driven primarily by hypercapnia rather than hypoxemia. Arousal response to hypoxemia can be reduced as much as two-thirds in REM sleep. In experimental data, patients were observed to have a decrease in oxygen saturation into the 70% range without an arousal response.33,36,37 Conversely, small alterations in pCO2 can lead to an increase in minute ventilation.38,39

PMC3986113_9	"In severe COPD, oxygen saturations may decrease by 40% during REM sleep and up to a 20% decrease during non-REM sleep.40 As stated previously, this is likely a result of increased physiologic dead space during sleep in COPD, along with a more profound decrease in alveolar ventilation at low tidal volumes compared to healthy individuals. Another key aspect of the significant nocturnal desaturations observed in COPD and overlap syndrome is related to oxygen tension and its dissociation from hemoglobin. Oxygen dissociation from hemoglobin is driven by many physiologic parameters. The baseline blood oxygen tension at rest is an influential factor based on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. In a subject with normal oxygen tension, the slope of the oxygen dissociation curve is shallow and thus changes in pO2 have less effect on measured oxygen saturation. As one moves along the curve towards lower oxygen tension, the slope increases dramatically. In patients with COPD with a reduced baseline pO2, the starting point is along a steeper slope, and small changes in pO2 will have a more profound effect on the oxygen saturation, as shown in Figure 4. The blunted neurochemical response, as well as a reduced muscular and ventilatory compensatory capability in patients with COPD and overlap syndrome may contribute to the profound oxygen desaturations observed in sleep.

Furthermore, 28.4% patients with AE-COPD admitted to the medical ICU had evidence of past pulmonary TB and all males among them were chronic smokers (Table 1). In a survey of 60000 men aged 20 to 50 years [20], a definite correlation between the incidence of pulmonary TB and smoking has been documented. Gajalakshmi et al [21] observed that, among urban men, the death rates from medical causes of ever smokers were double those of never smokers. Of this excess mortality among smokers, a third involved respiratory disease, chiefly TB (risk ratio ever to never smoked = 4.5) suggesting that smoking per se increased the incidence of clinical TB. It has been suggested that nicotine turns off the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) by the macrophages in the lungs, and since TNF- is crucial for the maintenance of the latent state within macrophages, reactivation may occur rendering the patient more susceptible to the development of progressive disease from latent M. tuberculosis infection [22]. Treated pulmonary TB is an important cause of COPD [23] and has been reported in 41% [24] to 68% [25] patients treated for pulmonary TB. Smoking seems to increase the incidence of TB and prevalence of COPD is high where smoking is highly prevalent,. Cavitation, extensive fibrosis, bulla formation and bronchiectasis have been implicated in the genesis of COPD caused by destroyed lung due to treated pulmonary TB. Thus, in areas such as India where pulmonary TB is highly endemic and smoking is on the rise, the prevalence of COPD is expected to increase and severe AE-COPD would become a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the ER. This intriguing relationship between smoking, pulmonary TB and COPD merits further study.

It is possible that this inflammatory infiltrate serves as a source of cytokines and growth factors leading to the medial hypertrophy, thickening, and luminal obstruction observed in smokers (Peinado et al 1999).

There is growing recognition that COPD is a systemic disease (Agusti et al 2003; Yende et al 2006) with multiple effects on end-organs including organs in the cardiovascular system (Camilli et al 1991; Sin and Man 2003). The pathophysiology of how COPD increases cardiovascular risk is largely unknown. Several studies have shown that reduced lung function is associated with an increase in a variety of systemic inflammatory markers (Schols et al 1999; Takabatake et al 2000; Godoy et al 2003). Gan and colleagues (2004) conducted a systematic review of studies involving the relationship between COPD, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and levels of various systemic inflammatory markers. Compared to healthy controls, COPD patients were found to have significantly raised levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, leucocytes, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-). All of which indicate persistent systemic inflammation. This finding may explain, at least in part, the high prevalence of systemic complications (including cardiovascular diseases) among patients with COPD (Gan et al 2004).

PMC2650600_1	"According to the Global Initiative for Asthma Guidelines (GINA 2002) asthma is defined as a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation evokes an associated increase in airway hyperresponsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction that is often reversible, either spontaneously or with treatment. In the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Guidelines (GOLD 2002; Rabe et al 2007), COPD is defined as a preventable and treatable disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. COPD is also associated with emphysematous parenchymal destruction, variable loss of lung elastic recoil, and abnormalities in gas diffusion. The physiological findings in individual patients with either clinical asthma or COPD, when isolated from the context of their environmental and clinical histories, may not allow the physician to distinguish between the conditions (Boulet et al 1998; Fabbri et al 2003). This inability to clearly differentiate these conditions can lead to frustration in both the clinic and research settings.

The number of inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils, are higher in COPD patients suffering exacerbations compared with stable COPD patients or healthy controls (Drost et al 2005). BAL fluid has been widely used for the assessment of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in asthma and COPD (Aaron et al 2001; Drost et al 2005). The most widely investigated marker of oxidant/antioxidant balance in BAL fluid is GSH, the levels of which are increased in smokers and patients with stable COPD compared to the nonsmokers, but reduced during exacerbations as compared to the levels found in stable COPD (Drost et al 2005). On the other hand, older smokers with a long-term smoking history exhibit elevated oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and protein carbonyls in their BAL fluid even in the absence of any lung disease, indicating that lung antioxidant defences have become overwhelmed the prolonged exposure to the noxious substances present in cigarette smoke (Nagai et al 2006). 8-isoprostane and some other oxidant markers have been compared between EBC and BAL, but clinical disease markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in EBC and BAL do not correlate with each other (Jackson et al 2007). Thus, even though some markers in BAL fluid may seem to offer promise in the assessment of inflammation, BAL is too invasive and not sensitive enough to be of use in the assessment of oxidative stress/airway inflammation in clinical practice.

PMC2650600_9	"The antioxidant machinery of the lung is complex, containing a variety of low molecular weight antioxidants, metal binding proteins, mucus glycoproteins, and several specific antioxidant enzymes (Kinnula et al 1995; Kinnula and Crapo 2003; Kinnula 2005a, 2005b). It is apparent that in oxidant-mediated airway diseases, ROS gradually overwhelm host antioxidant defenses, leading to the ultimate oxidant-mediated cell and tissue damage (Kinnula 2005b). Total antioxidant capacity of plasma is decreased in smokers and patients with asthma and COPD (Rahman et al 1996). It is interesting to note that the decrease in antioxidant capacity in smokers occurs transiently during smoking and resolves rapidly after smoking cessation. The depletion of total anti-oxidant capacity in smokers is associated with decreased levels of plasma antioxidants eg, ascorbic acid, vitamin E, -carotene, and selenium (Rahman et al 1996). The depletion of antioxidants may thus be a reflection of ongoing oxidative stress due to underlying inflammation in these diseases. The thiol antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and its key biosynthesizing enzyme, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), are decreased in the airways, and in macrophages of smokers compared to nonsmokers (Harju et al 2002a). However, very little is known about antioxidant enzymes/antioxidant biomarkers in asthma and COPD or their association with disease severity or progression. It is likely that there are no specific changes in the antioxidant systems during the early phases of airway diseases, instead their changes may reflect disease severity.

Additional demands are placed on the respiratory system by physical deconditioning and peripheral muscle dysfunction. Exercise training programs in COPD have the goal of improving cardiovascular fitness, increasing aerobic capacity of muscles and decreasing symptoms. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs have also been shown to decrease the number of exacerbations and shorten the length of hospital stay during an exacerbation (Hunter and King 2001; Nici et al 2006). Although most of these studies were conducted in patients with moderate to severe disease, several studies were evaluated patients with mild COPD (Bianchi et al 2002; Clark et al 2000; Dourado et al 2006; Garrod et al 2004; Kamahara et al 2004; Karapolat et al 2007; Rossi et al 2005). Clinical outcomes were measured by activity endurance (6 minute walk test) as well as with a quality of life instrument such as the St Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). One study found that muscle function and oxygen utilization (VO2max, VTmax, paired t-test) improved after a 12-week rehabilitation program involving isokinetic strength training (Clark et al 2000), while another showed improved exercise endurance with pulmonary rehabilitation (R2 = 0.146) (Eakin et al 1992). However, the beneficial effects of pulmonary rehabilitation appear to be time-limited and wears off over time unless the exercise program is continued (Karapolat et al 2007). Additionally, pulmonary rehabilitation programs that are longer in duration appear to be superior to short programs. One study found that a 20-session course led to improved 6 minute walk distance and better quality life compared with a 10-session course. Thus, pulmonary rehabilitation program should be considered for patients with mild COPD, who are symptomatic and are experiencing limitations in activity endurance and reduced quality of life.

Behavioral interventions, on the other hand, focus on breaking the smoking habit by avoiding smoking triggers such as drinking coffee or alcohol or associating with friends who smoke.

The major goals of NRT are to 1) attenuate withdrawal symptoms, 2) eliminate craving; and 3) make smoking less rewarding. NRT generally doubles the cessation rate compared to physician advice alone (Molyneux 2004). High doses of NRT are more effective than lower doses but are fraught with more side effects (Schroeder 2005). However, for those patients refractory to the lower doses, higher doses should be considered. Side effects include insomnia, skin irritation (for patches), and early morning cravings for nicotine. There are 6 ways in which NRT can be administered: as a patch, gum, sublingual tablet, lozenge, nasal spray, or inhaler. The patches are the most common mode of delivery and are found in 16-hour (5, 10, 15 mg) or 24-hour (7, 14, 21 mg) formulations.

For example, resveratrol, which is found in red wine, can inhibit NF-B activity and induce apoptosis in transformed cells, which may reduce mortality from coronary heart diseases, certain cancers and inflammatory diseases (Holmes-McNary and Baldwin 2000). Resveratrol has strong inhibitory effects on iNOS expression and NO generation in activated macrophages (Tsai et al 1999). Since treatment of macrophages with resveratrol blocks LPS-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IB to decrease NF-B DNA binding activity, is suggestive of the fact that its anti-inflammatory effects may be due at least in part to the inhibition of NF-B-dependent NO synthesis (Tsai et al 1999).

Clinical research in patients with established COPD showed inflammation with cells involved in innate immunity including macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells (predominantly CD8+, but less prominent in severe COPD) (Grashoff et al 1997; Di Stefano et al 2001; Hogg 2004; Barnes and Stockley 2005; De Boer 2005).

Differences between the outcomes of studies may be due to inclusion criteria, numbers of participating patients, the COPD phenotype studied or the pulmonary location of sampled tissue.

This suggestion was based on observations showing the presence of T cells (CD8+and CD4+), B cell follicles in the airway walls, and clonal expansion of CD4+T cells in lung tissue, the presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies with tobacco-like activity, and induction of emphysema in rats via a CD4+ and in mice via a CD8+ cell-specific mechanism (Saetta et al 1999; Koethe et al 2000; Sullivan et al 2005; Taraseviciene-Stewart et al 2005; Gosman, Willemse et al 2006; van der Strate et al 2006; Maeno et al 2007).

Small molecule inhibitors of MAP kinase p38, such as SB 203580, SB 239063 and RWJ 67657 having a broad range of anti-inflammatory effects have been developed (Kumar et al 2003) (Table 2). Administration of SB203580 has beneficial effects in animal disease models such as collagen-induced arthritis and endotoxin-induced septic shock (Lee et al 1999). p38 has also been shown to upregulate cytokine production by several independent mechanisms, including direct phosphorylation of transcription factors, and direct or indirect (through downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2) stabilization and increased translation of mRNAs containing 3% untranslated region adenylate/uridylate-rich elements (AREs) by phosphorylation of AREbinding proteins (Dean et al 2004; Briata et al 2005; Hitti et al 2006).

Many factors affect the ability of such studies to draw definitive conclusions about COPD exacerbations and make it difficult to compare studies. One major factor is the heterogeneous nature of COPD.42 This factor is further accentuated because 3 of the studies17,43,44 included unselected subjects whereas the other studies included only patients with COPD. Another variable is the method used to detect COPD exacerbation. Relying on the ability of patients to recall exacerbations17,45 may not be as accurate as active surveillance.43,46,47 Other confounding variables may include geography (eg, weather, climate, air pollution), genetic makeup of the population under study and frequency of follow-up.

Indeed, mild blockade of the muscarinic receptors with myorelaxants has been shown to attenuate the ventilatory response to hypoxia and to impair the contracting capacity of the pharyngo-laryngeal muscles, thereby interfering with the control of the upper airways (Eikermann et al 2006). In addition, volatile anesthetic agents and several pharmacologic agents (eg, magnesium, aminoglycosides) are known to enhance the effects of myorelaxants at the neuromuscular endplate by lowering the neural release of acetylcholine, inducing conformational change within the cholinergic receptor and/or by altering intra-muscular signaling (Eriksson 1994). Moreover, prolonged neuromuscular blockade should be anticipated in patients with defective metabolic clearance pathways (hepatic or renal insufficiency) and those with neuromuscular disorders (ie, myasthenia, deconditioning, Guillain-Barre syndrome), particularly if long acting myorelaxants are repeatedly or continuously administered.

By ventilating a whole fresh excised human lung that had been obtained at autopsy, and occasionally was available at the time of donation of organs for transplantation, it was possible to study lung mechanics both from lungs in subjects with no clinical lung disease and in patients with various stages of COPD. The investigators could measure many physiologic indices, including FEV1, FVC, maximum mid-expiratory flow, residual volume, and nitrogen washout tests, to study the physiologic expression of lesions of the small airways (Petty et al 1980, 1984, 1987). The measurement of the post-mortem FEV1 bore a close correlation with the FEV1 measured during life in the majority of patients (r=0.891), adjusted for both lungs (Petty et al 1965). Progressive grades of emphysema were associated with reductions in FEV1. The lesion of mucous gland hyperplasia (ie, the Reid index; Reid 1960) did not have a close correlation with airflow measurements.

PMC2707800_35	"The criteria for necessary hospital treatment, whether during admission to the emergency department, or during hospitalization, for exacerbations of COPD are described in the GOLD guidelines (GICOPD 2001). Hospital treatment is increasingly focused on the management of lung function and associated complications, particularly considering the increased number of early discharges (MacNee and Calverley 2003). Firstly, it is necessary to establish whether the exacerbation of COPD may be life-threatening and if this is the case the patients must be admitted to intensive care. The risk of mortality from exacerbations of COPD is connected with the level of respiratory acidosis, the presence of concomitant diseases, and the need for assisted ventilation (Connors et al 1996). In the absence of these characteristics, the risk of mortality is low, even though patients with severe COPD require hospitalization (GICOPD 2001). In these cases the effectiveness of home treatment is poor (Shepperd, Harwood, Gray, et al 1998). However, the results are better if home treatment follows a careful assessment in the emergency department and is combined with adequate doctor- or nurse-administered home care (Gravil et al 1998). Controlled oxygen therapy is the cornerstone of hospital treatment of exacerbations of COPD (GICOPD 2001). It is relatively easy to achieve adequate oxygenation (PaO2 > 60 mmHg or SaO2 > 90%) in uncomplicated exacerbations, but CO2 retention can occur (GICOPD 2001). 2-agonists are the main bronchodilators used for the treatment of exacerbations of COPD (Siafakas et al 1995; Celli 1996; BTS 1997). If rapid bronchodilation does not occur with these drugs, an antimuscarinic agent may be administered, even if the effectiveness of this combination is controversial (Fernandez et al 1994; Moayyedi et al 1995). The role of theophylline in the treatment of exacerbations of COPD is also controversial (GICOPD 2001). Theophylline leads to modest improvements in lung function without gas exchange deterioration (Barbera et al 1992; Mahon et al 1999). Administration of intravenous theophylline can be considered in more severe exacerbations (GICOPD 2001) although the available data do not support the use of methylxanthines for the treatment of exacerbations of COPD (Barr et al 2003). However, this requires close monitoring of the plasma concentrations to avoid the occurrence of dose-dependent toxic effects (Lloberes et al 1988; Emerman et al 1990; Barbera et al 1992). Oral or intravenous glucocorticoids are recommended with bronchodilator therapy and, if necessary, antibiotics and oxygen therapy, for treatment in hospital of exacerbations of COPD (Thompson et al 1996; Davies et al 1999; Niewoehner et al 1999; GICOPD 2001). The optimum dose of glucocorticoids is not known, but high doses increase the risk of significant side effects. Generally 30 mg to 40 mg of oral prednisolone is administered for 10 to 14 days (GICOPD 2001). Prolonged treatment does not improve efficacy, while increasing the risk of side effects. Antibiotics are only effective when exacerbations also occur with sputum purulence and increased sputum volume and/or fever, indicating a bacterial infection (Anthonisen et al 1987). Antibiotics must be effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. These are the bacterial microorganisms most frequently involved in exacerbations of COPD. However, the choice of antibiotics must be based on the antibiogram. Toxicity due to excessive oxygen therapy in the emergency department is still a prevalent problem which could be resolved by increasing patient awareness of the risk (Plant et al 2000a). In cases of severe exacerbations of COPD (stage III) mechanical ventilation is required which may be invasive (conventional) or non-invasive with the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality and improving symptoms. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is an effective alternative to conventional mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit and is even applicable in the general ward with specialized nursing staff (Brochard et al 1995; Plant et al 2000a). NIPPV reduces patient morbidity and length of stay in hospital by preventing the onset of nosocomial pneumonia, but it is less effective than intermittent positive pressure ventilation in patients with a pH persistently <7.30 (Plant et al 2000b).

PMC2707802_11	"The increase in inspiratory and expiratory airway resistance characteristic of COPD would cause only minor problems in ventilatory function (ie, for the respiratory muscles) if the disease, through expiratory flow limitation did not cause dynamic hyperventilation, and its corollaries that include increased elastic recoil, encroached tidal volume, the threshold load imposed by intrinsic PEEP, and the changes in the configuration of the thorax that greatly reduce their ability to generate pressure. When COPD patients with expiratory flow-limitation need to increase their respiratory rate to increase minute ventilation, there is potential for inspiratory muscle failure due to DH (Table 1). During exacerbations, the inflammatory process, the ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) mismatching, increased airflow resistance, and DH, expose the respiratory muscles to the risk of fatigue, eventually leading to ventilatory pump failure and hypercapnia (Rossi et al 1997). DH is one of the major mechanisms involved in the development of hypercapnia and (secondarily hypoxemia) during exercise in COPD patients (Diaz et al 2000; ODonnell et al 2002).

PMC2707802_28	"Several trials have compared noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) combined with either air or heliox in patients with exacerbations of COPD. In one well-designed trial, patients with acute exacerbations of COPD were treated with low or high pressure NPPV in combination with heliox or oxygen-supplemented air (Jaber et al 2000). Differences in breathing pattern, work of breathing, and gas exchange were measured in nine patients using an esophageal balloon technique. Heliox was not associated with changes in breathing pattern, whereas high pressure NPPV produced significant increases in tidal volume and minute ventilation. Heliox was associated with a reduction in PaCO2 and improvement in all measured indices of respiratory effort and work. The beneficial effects on the measured variables were further increased when high pressure NPPV was combined with heliox, compared with the low pressure/air group. The authors suggest that the addition of heliox to NPPV may allow a larger number of patients to benefit from NPPV. In addition, heliox may allow the use of lower levels of pressure support, which could reduce complications and patient discomfort resulting from high pressures and flow rates (Jaber et al 2000). A crossover study monitored the effects of NPPV plus either heliox (70:30) or oxygen (FiO2 0.30) on gas exchange and dyspnea in 19 patients with severe COPD (Jolliet et al 1999). The use of heliox decreased PaCO2, reduced dyspnea, and favorably changed the breathing pattern of patients. Peak inspiratory flow rates were higher, while inspiratory time and the ratio of inspiratory time to respiratory cycle length were both decreased. All of these findings suggest a reduced work of breathing. A third series of 23 intubated patients with COPD and respiratory failure found that the administration of heliox significantly reduced intrinsic PEEP, trapped lung volume, and peak and mean airway pressures (Tassaux et al 2000). Similar findings were noted in a second small study of 12 patients recovering from acute exacerbations of COPD. In this randomized prospective crossover trial, heliox decreased the resistive work of breathing and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP) without changing the breathing pattern (Diehl et al 2003).

Of note, while this rate may be approximately double the normal rate of decline, this small absolute change per year could be difficult to detect in short trials. Second, on average there is a dose-dependent loss in lung function: in general, greater amounts of smoking lead to greater declines in FEV1. Third, there is variable susceptibility to the effects of smoking. That is, for a given amount of smoking, there is a variable rate of decline in lung function among different subjects, presumably reflecting genetic37 or other environmental factors, although the rate of decline appears to be similar between men and women.35,38 Studies of lung function decline must be interpreted in terms of this Horse Racing Effect  the observation that in a race, the faster horse will be out in front in the middle of the race. In the context of smoking and lung function decline, subjects with evident lung function loss and clinical COPD are likely those with the fastest loss of lung function. Conversely, most smokers will not develop clinically significant COPD.39 Finally, the rate of lung function decline will slow, and may return to normal with smoking cessation. Whether the diagnosis of COPD by itself (ie, after smoking cessation) causes more rapid decline in lung function is unknown, and is difficult to decipher from the effects of smoking unless there is adequate follow-up time, typically several years.40 Airway inflammation continues to persist for many years after smoking cessation, and improvements in hospitalization are not generally seen until years after smoking cessation.12,41 Therefore definitive data regarding COPD alone without smoking are difficult to obtain.

Reactive oxygen species are produced in normal aerobic metabolism, and at physiological levels act in a beneficial manner, participating in cell signaling and host-defense against infection. However, higher concentrations of reactive oxygen species can mediate damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA, and drive inflammatory cascades. Reactive oxygen species generation is usually balanced by enzymatic (eg, superoxide dismutase) and nonenzymatic (eg, glutathione) antioxidant defense mechanisms. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant capacity. Oxidative stress impairs skeletal muscle contractility, and subjects with COPD have evidence of increased oxidative stress, particularly following exercise.93,99 This effect appears particularly marked in chronically hypoxemic subjects, in whom markers of oxidative stress are significantly increased in peripheral muscle specimens at rest and following exercise.100

Patients were randomized into four treatment arms: fluticasone for 6 months followed by 24 months of placebo, fluticasone for 30 months, fluticasone and salmeterol for 30 months, or placebo only.  Those treated with placebo or with fluticasone for the first 6 months had a decline in FEV1 of 87mL/year, and 65mL/year respectively.  Those treated with fluticasone for 30 months or fluticasone and salmeterol had a significantly reduced rate of FEV1 decline (+7.3mL/year for the former and 16mL/year for the latter).  Overall, fluticasone significantly diminished annual FEV1 decline over the last 2 years of the study when compared with placebo (CI, 43 to 129mL/year; P < .001).  It is important to note that 95% of these patients had never used ICS, and the majority of patients had airway hyperresponsiveness and revealed some acute reversibility of FEV1.

PMC3641739_26	"As mentioned above, pulmonary mechanics can affect cardiac function. In the context of airway obstruction, alveolar pressure increases and can exert a compressive effect on the neighboring pulmonary vasculature. As such, with marked hyperinflation, the pulmonary vascular resistance will increase. This scenario is especially relevant during extremes of hyperinflation, as seen in patients with acute exacerbations of asthma or COPD. Following the principles of ventricular-vascular coupling, the greater the degree of RV dysfunction at baseline, the greater the hemodynamic significance of any added vascular load imposed by the Starling resistor effect of airway pressure on pulmonary resistance. Some have theorized that the diseased lungs themselves may exert an external constraint on the heart, particularly when hyperinflated, thus modifying cardiac performance.[33] Moreover, marked changes in pleural pressure can also be transmitted to the heart and circulation, and may lead to significant increases in ventricular wall tension. Echocardiographic studies in patients with acute bronchoconstriction have shown acute RV dilatation during inspiration, with return of normal RV dimension during expiration, likely owed to the combined effects of hyperinflation on PVR and negative pleural pressure on RV wall tension. These same studies have shown that LV cavity dimensions reciprocally diminish during RV dilatation, which may explain the frequent finding of pulsus paradoxus in patients with acute bronchoconstriction.[1734]

The mean PA pressure was approximately 27 mmHg (systolic PA pressure 45-50 mmHg) with an average PVR of < 3 mmHg/l/min.[39] Similar hemodynamics were noted in the majority of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.[40] Likewise, most patients with sleep apnea have either normal or mildly increased PA pressure, with a normal or increased cardiac index and a PVR that rarely exceeds 3 mmHg/L/min.[15] In one study of morbidly obese subjects at the time of gastric bypass surgery, the average right atrial pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure were approximately 18 and 22 mmHg, respectively, while the average PVR was < 4 mmHg/l/min with an average RVEF > 40%.[41] Importantly, the predictors of PH during waking hours in patients with sleep apnea are not predicted by nocturnal events, with daytime hypoxemia, hypercapnia, greater body mass index, and decreased lung function (i.e., low FVC) being important associates. Also, it cannot be overemphasized that many patients with OSA and obesity hypoveniltation syndrome have increased left atrial pressure, and in several studies, left heart congestion has been shown to be the single most important predictor of pulmonary hypertension.[2021] In our experience, the vast majority of obese subjects with significant sleep-disordered breathing and moderate or greater degrees of PH have systemic hypertension and an increased left atrial pressure at the time of right heart catheterization, with a normal or increased cardiac output and a PVR that is within the normal range.

Diuretics should be used to treat volume excess, especially when associated with right heart congestion. Long term oxygen therapy is the cornerstone of treatment of PHD in patients with COPD and, along with smoking cessation, remains the only intervention associated with improved survival in COPD.[5657] Physicians treating patients with COPD over the past three decades will attest to the observed decline in PHD seen in the post oxygen therapy era. Patients should also be treated for ambulatory and nocturnal hypoxemia whenever possible.

PMC3869834_44	"Cindy et al92 recently published the first meta-analysis evaluating the effect of exercise training on measures of physical activity. This meta-analysis pointed out that supervised exercise training confers a significant but small effect on physical activity. The principal limitation of the meta-analysis was that the majority of the included studies did not use the same method to measure physical activity; moreover, it is well known that questionnaires and pedometers are an insufficiently sensitive means of detecting changes in physical activity in this particular clinical (slow-walking) population.90,93,94 When the authors considered only those studies that utilized a multisensory accelerometer to measure physical activity, they obtained more significant improvements in physical activity.92 Accelerometers or activity monitors are small devices carried on the arm, leg, or waist that measure energy expenditure, movement pattern, and body position over a period of time (24 hours to 7 days) and provide objective measurements of daily life activity (Figure 4). Two parameters appear to be crucial to enhancing physical activity in COPD patients after PR: the frequency of supervised exercise training and the duration of the program. Indeed, in the meta-analysis by Cindy et al,92 the studies that proposed an exercise training regimen of three times per week showed a significant increase in physical activity, in contrast with those that offered exercise only two times a week. Moreover, in a study measuring physical activity with an accelerometer, Pitta et al93 showed that a 6-month, supervised exercise training program was required to obtain a significant effect on physical activity, while three months was shown to be insufficient. This is consistent with the recent concept that 6 months are needed for most people to change behavior.95 The recording of spontaneous daily physical activity provides a new dimension in patient assessment that goes beyond any measurement of physiological capacity. Daily activity and the completion of domestic tasks are more important for the patient than an improvement in the 6-minute walk test, total CRQ score, or maximal load achieved during ergospirometry. Thus clinicians should take into account what people actually do (eg, walking, climbing stairs, dressing, etc), rather than what they are capable of doing since it is the natural level of physical activity that seems to best determine the prognostic benefit.96

PMC3869834_5	"For a long time, COPD was considered to be a respiratory disease, mainly caused by tobacco smoking and leading to progressive dyspnea. However, additionally, COPD produces inactivity, which promotes further loss of exercise capacity (deconditioning) through the loss of muscle mass, creating a vicious circle (Figure 1). Indeed, COPD has substantial manifestations beyond the lungs  the so-called systemic effects, such as unintentional weight loss and skeletal muscle dysfunction. The chronic systemic inflammation that is linked to COPD may also initiate or exacerbate comorbid diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, anemia, type 2 diabetes, lung cancer, and depression3,12,13 and is one of the key mechanisms underlying these extrapulmonary effects.1214 Consequently, COPD patients are disabled by the systemic manifestations of the disease, the most significant systemic dysfunction in COPD patients being the peripheral muscle dysfunction resulting from both physical inactivity and systemic inflammation,15,16 to which we can add hypoxemia, undernutrition, oxidative stress, and systemic corticosteroid therapy.16 This peripheral muscle dysfunction is related to diverse pathophysiological changes in the skeletal muscle, namely reduced oxidative capacity with early lactic acidemia and oxidative stress,1719 decrease in the volume of muscular fibers,20 fiber type redistribution (shift from type 1 to type 2 fibers),2022 and altered capillarization of these fibers.22 These alterations lead to higher concentrations of lactate for a given work, which stimulate ventilation, provoking dynamic hyperinflation and increasing ventilatory burden. Moreover, they induce an increasing susceptibility to muscular fatigue and a too early termination of exercise. The limitation of activity also promotes a sedentary lifestyle and the social isolation of COPD patients, with an increased risk of depression and anxiety, leading to further inactivity due to fear of breathlessness and consecutively further physical deconditioning. Exacerbations of COPD also promote the reduction of exercise performance, dyspnea, and the loss of HRQoL, accelerating the path of this vicious circle.23

PMC3933347_8	"During exercise, respiratory rate increases and VT expands to accommodate increased respiratory demands. The hyperpnea induces phasic activity of expiratory muscles in both healthy individuals and in those with COPD.30,31 In healthy individuals, the increased expiratory effort progressively decreases EELV and expiratory airflows are sufficient to allow complete exhalation of the inhaled VT before the next inhalation, even when breathing approaches maximal ventilation. In contrast, the combined effects of decreased lung elastic recoil pressure and increased airways resistance in patients with COPD results in an increased mechanical time constant for lung emptying in many alveolar units. Thus, as the respiratory rate and expiratory flow increases, the expiratory time available for exhalation can become insufficient and complete exhalation of VT to the relaxation volume becomes increasingly compromised, and EELV usually increases with hyperpnea.32 In addition, similar to healthy subjects, patients with COPD recruit expiratory muscles to increase their pleural and alveolar pressures, in an effort to increase expiratory flow. However, in these patients, the airways typically collapse when the pleural pressure becomes positive, thereby preventing increased expiratory flow.33 As a result, exhalation may not be completed prior to the onset of the next breath, causing an increase in operational lung volumes and progressive air retention called air trapping.13,26,34 This is referred to as dynamic hyperinflation, which can occur independently of static hyperinflation. Usually observed during exercise, the onset of dynamic hyperinflation will also occur at lower minute ventilations as disease severity limiting exhalation worsens, and may even occur during quiet breathing in severe patients or during an acute exacerbation.14,35

McKeever et al (2005) in a recently published study that analyzed data from over 13,000 individuals from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the USA, found a significant dose-response relationship between paracetamol and the prevalence of COPD, which was not found with aspirin and ibuprofen. Furthermore, paracetamol use was inversely associated with FEV1, whereas regular ibuprofen use was associated with a non-linear improvement in FEV1. It is hypothesized that regular paracetamol use depletes levels of the antioxidant, glutathione, in lung tissue, leading increased lung tissue damage. Ibuprofen may improve lung function through its anti-inflammatory effect. Even in asthma, ibuprofen does not appear to cause harm in population terms (Lesko 2003). In a large study, children with asthma were randomly assigned to receive paracetamol or ibuprofen for a febrile illness (Lesko et al 2002). Those on ibuprofen had significantly less asthma morbidity.

PMC2528206_71	"There is good evidence that patients benefit from advance care planning. In COPD patients, advance care planning increases patient satisfaction and sense of control, and reduces fear, anxiety and emotional distress (Smucker et al 1993; Heaven and Maguire 1997; Tierney et al 2001; Curtis et al 2004). The vast majority of COPD patients believe advance care planning is important, and wish to undertake these discussions (Heffner et al 1996; Guthrie et al 2001; Curtis et al 2002). Heffner et al surveyed 105 participants in pulmonary rehabilitation programs and found that over 98% wanted to take part in advance care planning. Surprisingly, given the overwhelming desire to discuss these issues, only 19% had had the opportunity to undertake it. Unmet information needs in COPD patients have been confirmed in subsequent studies (Gore et al 2000). Curtis et al (2004) examined patients perceptions of communication quality, and found that patients rated physicians poorly in the areas of discussing prognosis, the process of dying and spirituality. Over half of complaints received by the Healthcare Commission (2007) in the UK relate to end of life care, and the majority of these involve communication issues.

Several barriers to communication about end of life issues have been identified (Curtis et al 2000; Knauft et al 2005; Davison and Simpson 2006) (Table 3). There is a general consensus in the literature that the greatest impediment to good advance care planning is the difficulty of prognostication in COPD, and the consequent difficulty in timing such discussions (Curtis et al 2005). This should not, however, be such a significant concern. There is evidence that patients need information much earlier than is perceived by physicians (Heffner et al 1996; Sullivan et al 1996; Pfeifer et al 2003; Davison and Simpson 2006).

Nishimura et al (2002) found that the level of dyspnea significantly correlated with survival, and that dyspnea severity was more discriminatory that FEV1 in assessment of prognosis.

PMC2528217_16	"Noninvasive estimation of systolic pressures by Doppler echocardiography has been studied extensively for the detection of PH in individuals with COPD. Several techniques are used, but most frequently, tricuspid regurgitant flow is detected and the maximum jet velocity is measured by continuous wave Doppler. Using the Bernoulli principle, the peak velocity, v, is used to calculate the trans-tricuspid gradient, 4v2. The systolic PAP is considered equal to the RV systolic pressure as long as there is no evidence of RV outflow obstruction. RV systolic pressure is calculated as the sum of the trans-tricuspid gradient plus the estimated right atrial pressure (RAP). Early studies used a fixed estimation of 15 mmHg for RAP whereas subsequent studies estimate the RAP based upon the size of the inferior vena cava during inspiration: no collapse, 15 mmHg; partial collapse 10 mmHg; and complete collapse 5 mmHg (Bredikis and Liebson 1998; Arcasoy et al 2003). In addition to these estimations, determination of sPAP by Doppler echocardiography is limited by technical factors. Tricuspid insufficiency must be present to measure a maximal jet velocity. Chest wall configuration, especially the presence of air trapping and cardiac orientation, may affect the utility of this technique in patients with COPD (Arcasoy et al 2003).

RV muscular hypertrophy occurs in response to the increased pulmonary pressures (Dias et al 2002) and occurs in up to 40%70% of patients with COPD at autopsy (11,62). Hypertrophy is followed by contractile dysfunction of the RV (Voelkel et al 2006). The contractile dysfunction leads to RV dilation, a decrease in cardiac output, and an increase in right sided filling pressures (Voelkel et al 2006). The dilation and pressure overload of the RV causes left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (Louie et al 1995).

The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene contains insertion (I) or deletion (D) polymorphisms that create three genotypes (DD, II, and DI) (Rigatet al 1992). The deletion polymorphism is associated with increases in circulating angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels (Rigat et al 1990). The DI polymorphism is associated with the development of PH in Caucasians with COPD (Tkacova et al 2005). Additionally, the DI genotype may confer susceptibility to exercise induced PH in patients with COPD (Kanazawa et al 2000). Polymorphisms of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene are also present in patients with COPD. The BB polymorphism of the eNOS gene is associated with PH in patients with COPD. (Yildiz et al 2003). The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) plays a role in smooth muscle hyperplasia and vascular remodeling (Eddahibi et al 2001). L allelic polymorphisms of the 5-HTT gene promoter cause 5-HTT over-expression. LL and LS 5-HTT are more common in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) than in controls (Eddahibi et al 2001). In patients with COPD, the LL 5-HTT gene polymorphism is associated with the presence of PH in hypoxemic COPD patients and correlates with the severity of PH (Eddahibi et al 2003).

In mild exacerbations of COPD (pH > 7.35), NPPV seems to be of limited value and not being well tolerated by the patients, as indicated by a randomized controlled trial (Keenan et al 2005). In accordance with these findings, in patients with very severe ARF (pH < 7.25) the rate of NPPV failure was inversely related to the severity of respiratory acidosis (Ambrosino et al 2008). This indicates that severe acidosis resulting from acute exacerbation is a relevant predictor for treatment failure of NPPV (Plant et al 2001), in addition to being a prognostic factor for mortality per se (Jeffrey et al 1992; Plant et al 2000).

It is currently unknown whether the delivery of oxygen in the presence of PaO2 values >60 mmHg is beneficial in acute exacerbations. In any case, short-term and repeated evaluations of gas exchange indices are commonly recommended to verify treatment effects and to exclude a significant CO2 retention or an impending respiratory acidosis that may result from the reduction in hypoxic drive to breathe, or ventilation/perfusion mismatching (Aubier et al 1980b; Robinson et al 2000). As yet, clinical investigations dealing with these safety issues in, however, small samples of patients have suggested that the risk of worsening an existing hypercapnia is low during controlled oxygen delivery in acute exacerbations (Agusti et al 1999; Gomersall et al 2002).

PMC2650600_22	"There are many volatile hydrocarbons, but only a few of them have been analyzed from exhaled air, with the most widely investigated being ethane. Elevated exhaled ethane levels have been detected in patients with mild steroid-nave asthma compared with steroid-treated patients and normal subjects (Paredi et al 2000a). COPD patients display elevated exhaled ethane levels that correlate with the degree of airway obstruction (Paredi et al 2000b). Exhaled ethane, however, is increased by physical (Leaf et al 1997) and mental stress and smoking (Habib et al 1995), probably due to the high concentrations of hydrocarbons and direct oxidative damage. Cigarette smoke itself contains ethane, and a transient elevation of exhaled ethane has also been detected in healthy smokers (Habib et al 1995). Another hydrocarbon of clinical interest is n-pentane and there are some correlations between breath pentane and serum biomarkers in smokers. Ethane is easier and faster to measure by GC/MS than the other hydrocarbons, but nonetheless these assays are difficult to conduct as the analyses require expertise, their measurement is expensive, and the biomarker itself is not specific for any particular airway disease. Moreover primary health care centers may not have access to a gas chromatograph or the necessary skills inherent in this technique. In brief, the measurement of ethane is demanding and difficult to transfer to clinical practice (Larstad et al 2002; Barnes et al 2006). Moreover, aldehydes can be detected both in EBC and induced sputum but their relative concentrations are different and do not correlate with each other (Corradi et al 2004). There are a number of other VOCs in addition to ethane; whether their combination, ie, VOC profiles can be developed to be assayed by modern small gas chromatographic techniques would be an interesting area for future research. Recently, one technique, so called the electronic nose, in which expiratory vital capacity is collected and then smellprints are analyzed by linear discriminant analysis, has been found to be a promising method in differentiating exhaled breath of patients with asthma from controls even though it appears to be less accurate in distinguishing the severity of asthma (Dragonieri et al 2007).

Other confounding factors include smoking, diurnal variation, age, alcohol consumption, caffeine and possibly also a diet rich in antioxidants. Several studies have also clearly revealed extensive variation in the levels of 8-isoprostane in nonsmokers and smokers suggesting that the commercial assay itself is variable. Based on the earlier and recent studies, it appears that EBC 8-isoprostane may not be very sensitive or specific biomarker of oxidative stress given the variability in its measurement.

PMC2650603_11	"There are two major categories of 2-agonists: short acting 2-agonists (SABA) and long-acting 2-agonists (LABA). SABAs have a rapid onset of action (13 minutes) and their pharmacologic effects last less than six hours (Rabe et al 2007). Thus, they provide quick relief of dyspnea and are best used as rescue medications for patients with intermittent symptoms. In patients with persistent symptoms, regular use of SABAs (usually four times a day) either alone or in combination (of 2-agonist and anticholinergic) is recommended. Of the SABAs, salbutamol (albuterol) is the most commonly used agent and can be delivered via a metered dose inhaler or a nebulizer. For patients with mild COPD who have symptoms refractory to SABAs, LABAs may be considered. The two most commonly used LABAs in clinical practice are salmeterol and formoterol. Both of these compounds have high affinity for 2-adrenoreceptors. Salmeterol is considered a partial agonist because the ligand-receptor coupling is incomplete. In contrast, formoterol binds completely to the 2-adrenoreceptor, making it a full agonist. Salmeterol binds to 2-adrenoreceptor in airway smooth muscle with an efficacy of 65% compared to formoterol (Ball et al 1991). Despite these differences, clinically, they appear to have similar effectiveness. On average, formoterol provides faster relief of symptoms than does salmeterol but salmeterol may provide longer duration of relief (Johnson, 1998). Although some safety concerns have been raised regarding their use in asthma (Martinez 2005; Salpeter et al 2006), LABAs appear to be safe in COPD (Calverley et al 2007).

PMC2695202_23	"The thiol antioxidant glutathione (GSH) is concentrated in epithelial lining fluid compared with plasma and has an important protective role in the airspaces and intracellularly in epithelial cells. Several studies have suggested that GSH homeostasis may play a central role in the maintenance of the integrity of the lung airspace epithelial barrier. Decreasing the levels of GSH in epithelial cells leads to loss of barrier function and increased permeability (Morrison et al 1999). Human studies have shown elevated levels of glutathione in epithelial lining fluid in chronic cigarette smokers compared with non-smokers (Morrison et al 1999). However, this increase is not present immediately after acute cigarette smoking (Morrison et al 1999). The two-fold increase in BALF GSH in chronic smokers may not be sufficient to deal with the excessive oxidant burden during smoking, when acute depletion of GSH may occur (Harju et al 2002). In addition, the immunoreactivity of -glutamylcysteine synthetase (-GCS; now called as glutmate cysteine ligase, GCL), the rate limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, was decreased in the airways of smokers compared to nonsmokers, suggesting that cigarette smoke predisposes lung cells to ongoing oxidant stress (Harju et al 2002). Neurohr and colleagues recently showed that decreased GSH levels in BALF cells of chronic smokers were associated with a decreased expression of -GCS/GCL-light subunit without a change in -GCS/GCL-heavy subunit expression (Neurohr et al 2003). Increasing the activity of -GCS/GCL, would be expected to increase cellular GSH levels. The induction of -GCS/GCL by molecular means to increase cellular GSH levels or -GCS/GCL gene therapy also holds great promise in protection against chronic inflammation and oxidant-mediated injury in COPD.

PMC2695202_7	"One of deleterious outcomes of oxidative stress is the remodeling of ECM leading to lung injury. ROS activate latent proforms of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) (Lindholt et al 2003), and antioxidant species decrease MMP expression and activation (Rajagopalan et al 1996). Cigarette smoke treatment of alveolar macrophages from subjects with COPD induced increased release of MMP-9 compared to that of non-smokers. MMP-9 has an ECM degrading activity, thus suggesting the role of oxidative components of cigarette smoke in increased elastolytic enzyme activity (Russell et al 2002). Increased proteolytic load due to MMP-9 has been attributed to increased neutrophil recruitment in the lungs that triggers degradation of ECM and basement membrane in the airways and lungs. Antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium chloride and apocynin decreased the production of MMP-2 and -9 in alveolar macrophages from surfactant protein D-deficient mice (Yoshida et al 2001). However, a recent study showed that mice lacking gp91phox, a phagocyte-specific component of the NADPH oxidase, developed extensive, spontaneous emphysematous destruction of their peripheral air spaces (Kassim et al 2005). In addition, peritoneal macrophages from gp91phox-null mice had greater MMP-12 activity than macrophages from wild type mice (Kassim et al 2005). These findings indicate that reactive intermediates provide a physiological mechanism to protect tissues from excessive macrophage-mediated damage during inflammation. Factors other than oxidative stress, such as ozone and lipid peroxides also induce collagen I and MMP-1 gene expression (Choi et al 1994). Other forms of oxidative stress derived from tert-butyl hydroperoxide and iron can also modify collagen synthesis, by a mechanism presumably involving redox sensor/receptor.

Two phenotypes of COPD emerged, the so-called American Emphysema and British Bronchitis. Both Fletcher and Burrows showed similarities between these two conditions,5,6 which were later shown to have similar mortality.7 It is worth noting that at this stage the definition of COPD was clinicoradiological.7 William Briscoe is believed to be the first person to use the term COPD in discussions at the 9th Aspen Conference8 and Sukumalchantra and Williams were one of the first groups of authors to publish data using the term COPD.9 Following these earlier works, the anatomic location of the primary lesion in COPD was shown to be the small airway and the basis of COPD pathology was suggested to be inflammation.1012 In 1995 both the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society published for the first time standards for the diagnosis of COPD.13,14 These standards established the spirometric basis for the definition of COPD.

This question has now been answered by the INSPIRE Study which is the first long-term study of COPD exacerbations to compare the two types of exacerbations using the so-called symptom-based definition as well as the treatment-based definition.47,51 The results of the INSPIRE study show that if a symptom-based definition is used exclusively then the exacerbation rate detected is 3 per year but if a treatment-based definition is used then the rate detected is approximately 50% of this or about 1.5 exacerbations per year. Thus about 50% of symptom-defined COPD exacerbations are not treated by physicians and this may represent a different type of exacerbation.

The rationale for the ISOLDE study was based on 3 previous studies all having positive effects on FEV1 decline. One, a large, retrospective, open-label study, involved oral corticosteroids;105 another study was conducted in a combined pool of asthma and COPD patients;106,107 and finally, meta-analyses of ICS including (beclomethasone users).108 Though the ISOLDE study aimed for all severities of COPD, the mean FEV1 at recruitment was in fact 50% (SD 14.7%). This was the first prospective study to find an effect of ICS on any outcome measure in COPD. The study found no difference in the primary endpoint that was the annual decline in FEV1 in common with previous studies of budesonide.58,109 However the ISOLDE study found a 25% reduction in exacerbation rates in the fluticasone (500 g BD) arm compared to the placebo arm.50 Fluticasone propionate significantly reduced the rate of decline in quality of life, delaying the average time for a clinically important reduction in health status from 15 to 24 months compared to placebo. This was a landmark study in COPD therapeutics as it showed for the first time that health status declines at a measurable rate of 3.2 unit/year (in the placebo arm) and further that this outcome may be modified.63,110 From then on health status and exacerbation rates became accepted outcome measures in most interventional studies in COPD.

Medications were withdrawn prior to recruitment in the Szafranski study112 but patients in the Calverley study113 were optimized with oral steroid therapy prior to randomization as was done in the ISOLDE Study. Though the primary outcome measure of both the Calverley and Szafranski studies was exacerbation rate, it is interesting that both studies found only a trend toward a reduced exacerbation rate in the budesonide arm. Thus it is likely that they were underpowered to detect a difference in effects of ICS and had they been conducted over a longer period (eg, the ISOLDE Study, 3 years) the results might have been different. However we cannot draw definitive conclusions on relative efficacy of these ICS in COPD from these studies as there have been no head to head comparisons between fluticasone and budsonide

Withdrawal from the combination was significantly lower than that with the components alone, suggesting a relationship between efficacy and tolerability. This withdrawal rate matched that for the LABAICS combination in the INSPIRE trial,47 a head-to-head comparison with the long-acting anticholinergic drug tiotropium bromide and in which tiotropium was associated with a 42% withdrawal rate. Interpretation of the data from the INSPIRE study has not been supported by that of the UPLIFT study which showed a lower dropout rate in the tiotropium arm, though the designs of these two studies were different in that the INSPIRE study was largely a comparison of two arms each with monotherapy but the UPLIFT study allowed polytherapy in each arm.136 In the OPTIMAL Study137 premature discontinuation rates were as follows: 47% (tiotropiumplacebo), 43% (tiotropiumsalmeterol) and 26% (tiotropiumSFC) (p < 0.001). Discontinuation was due to a perceived lack of medication efficacy or physician directed and due to a perceived deterioration in health status. Of these early withdrawals the proportion receiving an open label ICSLABA combination were 74%, 70% and 54%, respectively.137 These results appear to support those of the INSPIRE study on withdrawals and may indicate a trend in patient preference. However compliance/satisfaction within a trial may not reflect behavior in clinical practice. One retrospective study in the Netherlands found that about 37% of new users of tiotropium continued treatment for 1 year, compared with 14% for ipratropium, 13% for LABA, and 17% for ICSLABA but compliance was increased in all groups after hospitalization.182 These results are supported by those of a Canadian study of inhaled steroids between 1990 and 1995.183 Differential withdrawal rates also complicate interpretation of data from trials, as a greater number of more severe patients are likely to withdraw from the placebo arm leaving the placebo arm containing a higher proportion of milder patients, potentially biasing against the beneficial effects of an intervention but also making an intent to treat analysis difficult (Table 2).

More sophisticated physiological assessment such as the determination of the anaerobic threshold during exercise (maximal oxygen consumption, VO2 max) and the six minutes walking test also provides valuable prognostic information in borderline patients (Win et al 2005). Before lung resection, a VO2 max less than 15 ml/kg/min, a walking distance less than 300 m over 6 minutes or the inability to climb at least four flights of stairs are better predictors than spirometric variables to discriminate those patients who will, or will not, develop cardiopulmonary complications.

By changing the position from upright to supine in healthy adults, the FRC is reduced by 0.81.0 L and there is a further decrease by 0.40.5 L after the induction of anesthesia. The reduction in FRC (from 3.5 to 2 L, near the residual volume) corresponds to the formation of atelectasis and low ventilation-perfusion areas (Figure 1) that in turn reduce the compliance of the respiratory system (from a mean of 95 to 60 ml/cm H2O). Not surprisingly, the size of the atelectatic areas correlates with the decrease in FRC and the fall in arterial oxygen saturation (Lindberg et al 1992).

Anti-adrenergic agents, platelet anti-aggregants and/or statins should be continued or started preoperatively (Karthikeyan and Bhargava 2006). Although beta-adrenergic blockers are contra-indicated in case of moderate-to-severe bronchospastic disorders, a meta-analysis supports the safety of selective beta1-blockers in the majority of COPD patients in whom FEV1 remains stable. In these circumstances, inhaled beta-2 adrenergic agonists are still effective in alleviating acute bronchoconstrictive exacerbations, despite chronic beta-blockade (McGory et al 2005). Patients with combined bronchospastic and coronary artery diseases might benefit from the administration of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (ie, clonidine, dexmedetomidine). Indeed, these agents are devoid of any bronchospastic effect and have been shown to prevent myocardial ischemia while reducing anesthetic/analgesic requirements and blunting thermoregulatory shivering during the perioperative period (Salpeter et al 2004).

Noteworthy, patients presenting with one or more of these risk factors (RCRI), particularly those with limited exercise capacity (less than 4 MET; 1 MET = basal metabolic rate) and those undergoing major surgical procedure should be considered for preoperative non-invasive testing in order to exclude poor ventricular function, valvular dysfunction or silent coronary artery disease. Ultimately, preoperative clinical assessment (RCRI) and cardiac testing (thallium scintigraphy, echocardiography, stress test) are most useful to identify patients with ischemic heart diseases who might benefit from preoperative revascularization and perioperative cardiac protective techniques (ie, beta-blockers, anti-platelets, statines) (Fleisher et al 2006).

If lung volume measurements are also considered, the overall bronchodilator response may improve up to 76% of the severely hyperinflated group and up to 62% of the moderately hyperinflated ones. Changes in volumes correlated poorly with changes in maximal airflows. Surprisingly TLC was also slightly reduced (about 2.5%) by bronchodilators suggesting that the changes in airways resistance or the familiarity with the method may have affected the constant volume plethysmographic technique used to measure volumes (Newton et al 2002). Unless salbutamol had produced changes in the ability to generate force by the respiratory muscles, or the elastic properties of the lung, both of which it are unlikely. Ramirez-Venegas and colleagues (1997) found that the use of salmeterol reduced not only dyspnea but improved lung function in patients with COPD. Patients showed an increase in FVC, a reduction in RV and FRC, and no changes in TLC following inhalation of salmeterol. Boni and colleagues (2002) studied 20 COPD, 11 with flow limitation using the negative expiratory pressure before and after the inhalation of 400g salbutamol. Following salbutamol, IC did not change in non-flow limited patients but increased significantly in the flow-limited ones. Dyspnea decreased in relation to IC at rest even in the absence of a significant improvement in FEV1. Di Marco and colleagues (1993) found that in patients with decreased baseline inspiratory capacities; there was a much greater increase of IC after administration of bronchodilators such as salbutamol, formoterol, salmeterol, and oxitropium. This increase correlated closely with improvement in a sensation of dyspnea. Celli and colleagues (2003) evaluated the long-term effects (4 weeks) of 18 g/day of tiotropium. Significant similar improvements in the area under the curve of FEV1 and IC and over the curve in FRC were observed, reflecting sustained improvements in hyperinflation. ODonnell, Fluge, and colleagues (2004) and Maltais and colleagues (2005) conducted a multicentric study on the long-term effects (6 weeks) of 18g/day of tiotropium. Tiotropium reduced lung hyperinflation indices at rest and during exercise, and improved exercise tolerance 8 h after the inhalation of the drug. Finally ODonnell, Voduc, and colleagues (2004) studied the effects of 50g of inhaled salmeterol. After salmeterol versus placebo at rest, IC increased and FRC decreased at a standardized time during exercise. In addition, IC and VT increased and dyspnea decreased. Significant increments in peak ventilation, oxygen uptake, and the duration of the incremental test were also seen. Man and colleagues (2004) studied 16 patients with irreversible severe COPD after two weeks of treatment with 50g of salmeterol twice a day. Salmeterol significantly reduced the transdiaphragmatic pressure-time product, DH, and Borg scores during endurance treadmill walk, however there was no significant change in exercise endurance time.

It consists of superimposing a flowvolume loop of a tidal breath within a maximum flowvolume curve. Expiratory flow limitation is not present when the patient breathes below the maximal expiratory flowvolume curve (Pride 1999). This method to detect expiratory flow limitation has several methodological deficiencies such as intrathoracic gas compression artefacts (which only can be detected with a constant pressure body plethysmograph (Ingram and Schilder 1966), incorrect alignment of tidal with maximal expiratory flowvolume curve considering the TLC as a fixed reference point, which is not always valid (Younes and Kivinen 1984; DAngelo et al 1993). Respiratory mechanics and the intrathoracic pressure swinging are different during the tidal and maximal expiratory efforts and exercise may result in changes in airways tone (Beck et al 1994). Another important limitation of the conventional method is that it requires patient cooperation.

Although the definition is imprecise (and sometimes controversial), exacerbations are usually defined clinically by worsening symptoms, and are often associated with worsening pulmonary function and increased local and systemic inflammation.50 Those with frequent exacerbations appear to have more rapid decline in lung function and increased mortality (see Figure 3).5153 Airway infection due to a variety of bacterial and/or viral pathogens is the most likely cause of exacerbations.54,55 Environmental exposures such as air pollution may also play a role, however, in up to one third of cases, no clear precipitant for the exacerbation can be identified.10 Because the same bacteria can be recovered from the lungs of COPD patients both before and during an exacerbation, bacterial infection was often dismissed as a cause for exacerbation. However, Sethi and colleagues found that exacerbations were associated with changes in the specific bacterial strain, suggesting that exacerbations can follow the acquisition of new pathological strains. Pathogens may more easily cause infection in the COPD lung, in which several normal defense mechanisms of innate immunity are impaired.

Fasting blood glucose levels did not change in COPD patients without comorbid DM. These findings suggest that roflumilast may improve glycemic control in patients with co-morbid DM.78 In a separate study, roflumilast improved fructosamine levels, a marker of short-term DM control, and HbA1c in patients with treatment naive DM type 2 but who did not have COPD.79 Further studies will be required to determine how roflumilast affects DM control, whether DM outcomes improve, and whether it can prevent some of the complications of DM.

The benefits of the medication were less obvious in the earlier studies which included patients with milder disease. Although roflumilast improved pulmonary function and reduced AECOPD, it only mildly improved symptoms and quality of life scores. Patients with milder disease generally do not experience frequent AECOPD. Consequently, any benefit was not as impressive as in the studies with patients with more severe disease. There is not enough evidence to recommend its use in patients with mild disease so it will not have an indication as a first-line treatment. The data for its use was most compelling in patients with the chronic bronchitis phenotype and a history of frequent AECOPD.83 Patients with chronic bronchitis have more severe airway inflammation that increases further with exacerbations which may explain why these features were predictive of a beneficial response to an anti-inflammatory medication. Exacerbations were decreased and lung function improved when patients with that clinical profile were treated with roflumilast. It was effective when added to short-acting bronchodilators, long-acting beta agonists, or to tiotropium.63,75 A post hoc analysis of two earlier studies demonstrated that it was also effective when added to IHCS.74 Although contraindicated as monotherapy in COPD, IHCS appear to be beneficial when combined with LABAs in patients with more severe disease.2931 There are no head-to-head studies comparing the effectiveness of roflumilast versus IHCS as add-on therapy to long-acting bronchodilators but the addition of roflumilast to LABA resulted in similar reductions in the exacerbation rate as the addition of IHCS.2931,75 Another option would be the addition of roflumilast to combined LABA and LAAC therapy. The addition of IHCS to the combination of LABA and LAAC did not reduce the overall AECOPD rate but did reduce the rate of severe AECOPD requiring hospitalization.41 The increase in pulmonary function reported with the addition of IHCS to LABA was similar to the increases demonstrated by adding roflumilast to either class of long-acting bronchodilator.75 A clinical trial comparing the addition of IHCS versus the addition of roflumilast to combined LAAC and LABA therapy could determine which strategy is superior.

Pulmonary heart disease is nearly always associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH), which falls under the World Health Organization's Group III category-pulmonary hypertension Associated with Lung Diseases and/or Hypoxemia. Many prefer the term chronic respiratory disorder (CRD) as this description accounts for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), interstitial lung diseases (ILD), and the hypoventilatory disorders.[23] Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; WHO Group I) and chronic thromboembolic disease (WHO Group IV) are diseases largely isolated to the pulmonary vasculature, and are thus excluded from discussions on PHD. However, PAH and thromboembolic-related PH are prototype conditions, where pulmonary vascular disease and its imposed limitations on the RV in part provide a framework for our understanding of the ways in which altered lung structure and function can affect the heart and, moreover, how treatment of these conditions leads to predictable improvements in right heart function, thus translating into improvements in functional status and outcome in these patients.

PMC3641739_3	"The RV is a thin-walled, distensible structure approximately one-sixth the mass of the left ventricle. It is anatomically linked to the left ventricle via the shared interventricular septum and interlacing epicardial muscle fibers. The pulmonary vasculature is comprised of thin-walled proximal pulmonary arteries and less prominent resistance arterioles. Pulmonary artery compliance is one-half and vascular resistance one-tenth systemic values. Normal respiratory function requires normal parenchymal lung structure, thus normal airways and terminal alveoli, a normal alveolar-capillary interface, and normal lung and chest wall compliance. Descent of the diaphragm and chest wall expansion with inspiration typically generate a fall in pleural pressure of 3-5 cm H2O, which is sufficient to generate a normal tidal volume of 5-7 cc per kilogram. The normal fall in pleural pressure is partially transmitted across the thin-walled pulmonary vessels, causing modest differences between right atrial, pulmonary arterial, and left atrial (also, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, PAWP) pressures between inspiration and end-expiration. Correct measurement of these pressures should be done at end-expiration, when gas flow and pressure in the lung is near zero, allowing for pressure estimation in the absence of respiratory influence. The appropriate matching of ventilation and perfusion as well as normal alveolar-capillary diffusion distance typically ensure normal oxygenation, while normal ventilation requires appropriate central control and peripheral (airway, chest wall) function to regulate arterial carbon dioxide tension.

PMC3641739_46	"The third condition that must be met is that pulmonary vasodilation should not worsen gas exchange to the point that the drop in oxygen saturation occurs in disproportion to an improvement in cardiac output. If the relative degree of hypoxia exceeds the relative rise in cardiac output, then the net effect may be reduced peripheral oxygen delivery. In contrast, if there is a mild reduction in oxygen saturation in response to PH specific therapy, yet a marked rise in cardiac output owed to improved right heart function, net oxygen delivery to tissue may still be significantly elevated despite a modest increase in hypoxia. It seems logical that an essential element to avoiding the scenario where PH specific therapy would lead to hypoxia in disproportion to improved cardiac function is to select the appropriate PH phenotype. In patients with PAH, pulmonary vasodilating therapy often improves oxygenation by improving V/Q mismatch (via a drop in PVR), improving the transport of more saturated mixed venous blood to the alveolar-capillary interface (via the increase in cardiac output), and occasionally, by alleviating a right to left shunt through a patent foraman ovale as the right atrial pressure falls. In a Type II PHD patient, the circulatory physiology resembles PAH. As such, even if there is some degree of intrapulmonary shunt that occurs in response to pulmonary vasodilatation, an improved cardiac output (and thus, delivery of more oxygenated mixed venous blood to the alveolar-capillary interface) and falling right atrial pressure (and alleviation of a right to left shunt) can offset the effect of the shunt, leading to stable or even improved oxygenation.
